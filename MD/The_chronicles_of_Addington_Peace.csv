"I, James Phillips, stood with my back to the fire, smoking and  
puzzling over it.  It was worth all the headlines the newspapers 
had  
given it; there was no loophole to the mystery. ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"Both sides of the Atlantic knew Silas J. Ford.  He had established
 a  
business reputation in America that had made him a celebrity in  
England from the day he stepped off the liner.  Once in London his
  
syndicates and companies and consolidations had startled the  
slow-moving British mind.  The commercial sky of the United 
Kingdom  
was overshadowed by him and his schemes.  The papers were full of
  
praise and blame, of puffs and denunciations.  He was a 
millionaire;  
he was on the verge of a smash that would paralyze the markets of 
the  
world.  He was an abstainer, a drunkard, a gambler, a most 
religious  
man.  He was a confirmed bachelor, a woman hater; his engagement 
was  
to be announced shortly.  So was the gossip kept rolling with the
  
limelight always centred upon the spot where Silas J. Ford 
happened  
to be standing.  
  
And now he had disappeared, vanished, evaporated.  
  
On the night of December 18, a Thursday, he had left London for  
Meudon Hall, the fine old Hampshire mansion that he had rented 
from  
Lord Beverley.  The two most trusted men in his office accompanied
  
him.  Friday morning he had spent with them; but at three o'clock 
the  
pair had returned to London, leaving their chief behind.  From 
four  
to seven he had been shut up with his secretary.  It was a hard 
time  
for every one, a time verging upon panic, and at such times Silas 
J.  
Ford was not an idle man.  
  
At eight o'clock he had dined.  His one recreation was music, and
  
after the meal he had played the organ in the picture gallery for 
an  
hour.  At a quarter past eleven he retired to his bedroom, 
dismissing  
Jackson, his body servant, for the night.";0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0
"Three-quarters of an 
hour  
later, however, Harbord, his secretary, had been called to the  
private telephone, for Mr. Ford had brought an extension wire from
  
the neighboring town of Camdon.  It was a London message, and so  
urgent that he decided to wake his chief.  There was no answer to 
his  
knock, and on entering the room he found that Mr. Ford was not in
  
bed.  He was surprised, but in no way suspicious, and started to  
search the house.  He was joined by a footman, and, a little 
later,  
by Jackson and the butler.  Astonishment changed to alarm.  Other
  
servants were roused to aid in the quest.  Finally, a party, 
provided  
with lanterns from the stables, commenced to examine the grounds.
  
  
Snow had fallen early in the day, covering the great lawns in 
front  
of the entrance porch with a soft white blanket, about an inch in
  
thickness.  It was the head groom who struck the trail.  
Apparently  
Mr. Ford had walked out of the porch, and so over the drive and  
across the lawn toward the wall that bounded the public road.  
This  
road, which led from Meudon village to the town of Camdon, crossed
  
the front of Meudon Hall at a distance of some quarter of a mile.
  
  
There was no doubt as to the identity of the footprints, for Silas
  
Ford affected a broad, square-toed boot, easily recognizable from 
its  
unusual impression.  
  
They tracked him by their lanterns to the park wall, and there all
  
trace of him disappeared.  The wall was of rough stone, easily  
surmountable by an active man.  The snow that covered the road  
outside had been churned into muddy paste by the traffic of the 
day;  
there were no further footprints observable. ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"The party returned to the house in great bewilderment.  The 
telephone  
to London brought no explanation, and the following morning Mr.  
Harbord caught the first train to town to make inquiries.  For  
private reasons his friends did not desire publicity for the 
affair,  
and it was not until the late afternoon, when all their  
investigations had proved fruitless, that they communicated with  
Scotland Yard.  When the papers went to press the whereabouts of 
the  
great Mr. Ford still remained a mystery.";0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0
"In keen curiosity I set off up the stairs to Inspector Peace's 
room.  
Perhaps the little detective had later news to give me.  
  
I found him standing with his back to the fire puffing at his  
cigarette with a plump solemnity.  A bag, neatly shaped, lay on 
the  
rug at his feet.  He nodded a welcome, watching me over his 
glasses.  
  
""I expected you, Mr. Phillips,"" he said.  ""And how do you explain 
it?""  
  
""A love affair or temporary insanity,"" I suggested vaguely.  
  
""Surely we can combine those solutions,"" he smiled.  ""Anything 
else?""  
  
""No.  I came to ask your opinion.""  
  
""My mind is void of theories, Mr. Phillips, and I shall endeavor 
to  
keep it so for the present.  If you wish to amuse yourself by  
discussing possibilities, I would suggest your consideration of 
the  
reason why, if he wanted to disappear quietly, he should leave so
  
obvious a track through the snow of his own lawn.  For myself, as 
I  
am leaving for Camdon via Waterloo Station in ten minutes, I shall
  
hope for more definite data before night.""  
  
""Peace,"" I asked him eagerly, ""may I come with you?""  
  
""If you can be ready in time,"" he said.  
  
It was past two o'clock when we arrived at the old town of Camdon.
  A  
carriage met us at the station.  Five minutes more and we were 
clear  
of the narrow streets and climbing the first bare ridge of the 
downs.  
It was a desolate prospect enough--a bare expanse of wind-swept 
land  
that rose and fell with the sweeping regularity of the Pacific 
swell.  
Here and there a clump of ragged firs showed black against the 
snow.  
Under that gentle carpet the crisp turf of the crests and the 
broad  
plow lands of the lower ground alike lay hidden.  I shivered, 
drawing  
my coat more closely about me.  
  
It was half an hour later that we topped a swelling rise and saw 
the  
gray towers of the ancient mansion beneath us.  In the shelter of 
the  
valley by the quiet river, that now lay frozen into silence, the  
trees had grown into splendid woodlands, circling the hall on the
  
further side.  From the broad front the white lawns crept down to 
the  
road on which we were driving.  Dark masses of shrubberies and the
  
tracery of scattered trees broke their silent curves.  The park 
wall  
that fenced them from the road stood out like an ink line ruled 
upon  
paper.  
  
""It must have been there that he disappeared,"" I cried, with a  
speculative finger.  
  
""So I imagine,"" said Peace.  ""And if he has spent two nights on 
the  
Hampshire downs, he will be looking for a fire to-day.  You have  
rather more than your fair share of the rug, Mr. Phillips, if you
  
will excuse my mentioning it.""  
  
A man was standing on the steps of the entrance porch when we 
drove  
up.  As we unrolled ourselves he stepped forward to help us.  He 
was  
a thin, pale-faced fellow, with fair hair and indeterminate eyes.
  
  
""My name is Harbord,"" he said.  ""You are Inspector Addington 
Peace, I  
believe.""  
  
His hand shook as he stretched it out in a tremulous greeting.  
Plainly the secretary was afraid, visibly and anxiously afraid.  
  
""Mr. Ransome, the manager of Mr. Ford's London office, is here,"" 
he  
continued.  ""He is waiting to see you in the library.""  
  
We followed him through a great hall into a room lined with books
  
from floor to ceiling.  A stout, dark man, who was pacing it like 
a  
beast in a cage, stopped at the sight of us.  His face, as he 
turned  
it toward us, looked pinched and gray in the full light.  
  
""Inspector Peace, eh?"" he said.  ""Well, Inspector, if you want a  
reward, name it.  If you want to pull the house down, only say the
  
word.  But find him for us, or, by heaven, we're done.""  
  
""Is it as bad as that?""  
  
""You can keep a secret, I suppose.  Yes--it couldn't well be 
worse.  
It was a tricky time; he hid half his schemes in his own head; he
  
never trusted even me altogether.  If he were dead I could plan  
something, but now--""  
  
He thumped his hand on the table and turned away to the window.  
  
""When you last saw Mr. Ford was he in good health?  Did he stand 
the  
strain?""  
  
""Ford had no nerves.  He was never better in his life.""  
  
""In these great transactions he would have his enemies.  If his 
plans  
succeeded there would be many hard hit, perhaps ruined.  Have you 
any  
suspicion of a man who, to save himself, might make away with Mr.
  
Ford?""  
  
""No,"" said the manager after a moment's thought.  ""No, I can not 
give  
you a single name.  The players are all big men, Inspector.  I 
don't  
say that their consciences would stop them from trying such a 
trick,  
but it wouldn't be worth their while.  They hold off when jail is 
the  
certain punishment.""  
  
""Was this financial crisis in his own affairs generally known?""  
  
""Certainly not.""  
  
""Who would know of it?""  
  
""There might be a dozen men on both sides of the Atlantic who 
would  
suspect the truth.  But I don't suppose that more than four people
  
were actually in possession of the facts.""  
  
""And who would they be?""  
  
""His two partners in America, myself, and Mr. Harbord there.""  
  
Peace turned to the young man with a smile and a polite bow.  
  
""Can you add any names to the list?"" he asked.  
  
""No,"" said Harbord, staring at the detective with a puzzled look, 
as  
if trying to catch the drift of his questions.  
  
""Thank you,"" said the Inspector; ""and now will you show me the 
place  
where this curious disappearance occurred?""  
  
We crossed the drive, where the snow lay torn and trampled by the
  
carriages, and so to the white, even surface of the lawn.  We soon
  
struck the trail, a confused path beaten by many footprints.  
Peace  
stooped for a moment, and then turned to the secretary with an 
angry  
glance.  
  
""Were you with them?"" he said.  
  
""Yes.""  
  
""Then why, in the name of common sense, didn't you keep them off 
his  
tracks?  You have simply trampled them out of existence, between 
you.""  
  
""We were in a hurry, Inspector,"" said the secretary meekly.  ""We  
didn't think about it.""  
  
We walked forward, following the broad trail until we came to a  
circular patch of trodden snow.  Evidently the searchers had 
stopped  
and stood talking together.  On the further side I saw the 
footprints  
of a man plainly defined.  There were some half-dozen clear  
impressions and they ended at the base of the old wall, which was
  
some six feet in height.  
  
""I am glad to see that you and your friends have left me 
something,  
Mr. Harbord,"" said the Inspector.  
  
He stepped forward and, kneeling down, examined the nearest 
footprint.  
  
""Mr. Ford dressed for dinner?"" he inquired, glancing up at the  
secretary.  
  
""Certainly!  Why do you ask?""  
  
""Merely that he had on heavy shooting boots when he took this 
evening  
stroll.  It will be interesting to discover what clothes he wore.""
  
  
The Inspector walked up to the wall, moving parallel to the tracks
 in  
the snow.  With singular activity for his plump and unathletic 
figure  
he climbed to the top and seated himself while he stared about 
him.  
Then on his hands and knees he began to crawl forward along the  
coping.  It was a quaint spectacle, but the extraordinary care and
  
vigilance of the little man took the farce out of it.  
  
Presently he stopped and looked down at us with a gentle smile.  
  
""Please stay where you are,"" he said, and disappeared on the 
further  
side.  
  
Harbord offered me a cigarette, and we waited with due obedience 
till  
the Inspector's bullet-head again broke the horizon as he 
struggled  
back to his position on the coping of the wall.  
  
He seemed in a very pleasant temper when he joined us; but he said
  
nothing of his discoveries, and I had grown too wise to inquire.  
When we reached the entrance hall he asked for Jackson, the valet,
  
and in a couple of minutes the man appeared.  He was a tall,  
hatchet-faced fellow, very neatly dressed in black.  He made a 
little  
bow, and then stood watching us in a most respectful attitude.  
  
""A queer business this, Jackson,"" said Addington Peace.  
  
""Yes, sir.""  
  
""And what is your opinion on it?""  
  
""To be frank, sir, I thought at first that Mr. Ford had run away; 
but  
now I don't know what to make of it.""  
  
""And why should he run away?""  
  
""I have no idea, sir; but he seemed to me rather strange in his  
manner yesterday.""  
  
""Have you been with him long?""  
  
""No, sir.  I was valet to the Honorable John Dorn, Lord Beverley's
  
second son.  Mr. Ford took me from Mr. Dorn at the time he rented 
the  
Hall.""  
  
""I see.  And now will you show me your master's room?  I shall see
  
you again later, Mr. Harbord,"" he continued; ""in the meanwhile I 
will  
leave my assistant with you.""  
  
We sat and smoked in the secretary's room.  He was not much of a  
talker, consuming cigarette after cigarette in silence.  The 
winter  
dusk had already fallen when the Inspector joined us, and we 
retired  
to our rooms to prepare for dinner.  I tried a word with Peace 
upon  
the staircase, but he shook his head and walked on.  ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"The meal dragged itself to an end somehow, and we left Ransome 
with a  
second decanter of port before him.  Peace slipped away again, and
 I  
consoled myself with a book in the library until half-past ten, 
when  
I walked off to bed.  A servant was switching off the light in the
  
hall when I mounted the great staircase";0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0
"My room was in the old wing at the further side of the picture  
gallery, and I had some difficulty in steering my way through the
  
dark corridors.  The mystery that hung over the house had shaken 
my  
nerves, and I remember that I started at every creak of a board 
and  
peered into the shadows as I passed along with, Heaven knows, what
  
ghostly expectations.  I was glad enough to close my door upon 
them  
and see the wood fire blazing cheerfully in the open hearth.  
  
. . . . . . . . . . . .  
  
I woke with a start that left me sitting up in bed, with my heart
  
thumping in my ribs like a piston rod.  I am not generally a light
  
sleeper, but that night, even while I snored, my nerves were 
active.  
Some one had tapped at my door--that was my impression.  
  
I listened with the uncertain fear that comes to the newly waked.
  
Then I heard it again--on the wall near my head this time.  A 
board  
creaked.  Some one was groping his way down the dark corridor  
without.  Presently he stopped, and a faint line of illumination  
sprang out under my door.  It winked, and then grew still.  He had
  
lighted a candle.  
  
Assurance came with the streak of light.  What was he doing, 
groping  
in the dark, if he had a candle with him?  I crept over to the 
door,  
opened it, and stared cautiously out.  
  
About a dozen feet away a man was standing, a striking figure 
against  
the light he carried.  His back was toward me, but I could see 
that  
his hand was shading the candle from his eyes while he stared into
  
the shadows that clung about the further end of the corridor.  
  
Presently he began to move forward.  
  
The picture gallery and the body of the house lay behind.  The  
corridor in which he stood terminated in a window, set deep into 
the  
stone of the old walls.  The man walked slowly, throwing the light
 to  
right and left.  His attitude was of nervous expectation--that of 
a  
man who looked for something that he feared to see.  
  
At the window he stopped, staring about him and listening.  He  
examined the fastenings, and then tried a door on his right.  It 
was  
locked against him.  As he did so I caught his profile against the
  
light.  It was Harbord, the secretary.  From where I stood he was 
not  
more than forty feet away.  There was no possibility of a mistake.
  
  
As he turned to come back I retreated into my room, closing the 
door.  
The fellow was in a state of great agitation, and I could hear him
  
muttering to himself as he walked.  When he had passed by I peeped
  
out to see him and his light dwindle, reach the corner by the 
picture  
gallery, and fade into a reflection, a darkness.  
  
I took care to turn the key before I got back into bed.";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"I woke again at seven, and, hurrying on my clothes, set off to 
tell  
Peace all about it.";0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0
"I took him to the place, and together we  
examined the corridor.  There were only two rooms beyond mine.  
The  
one on the left was occupied by Ransome; that on the right was a  
large store-room, the door of which was locked.  The housekeeper 
kept  
the key, we learned upon inquiry.  Whom had Harbord followed?  The
  
problem was beyond me.  As for Inspector Peace, he did not indulge
 in  
verbal speculations.";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"It was in the central hall that we encountered the secretary on 
his  
way to the breakfast-room.  The man looked nervous and depressed; 
he  
nodded to us and was passing on, when Peace stopped him.  
  
""Good-morning, Mr. Harbord,"" he said.  ""Can I have a word with 
you?""  
  
""Certainly, Inspector.  What is it?""  
  
""I have a favor to ask.  My assistant and myself have our hands 
full  
here.  If necessary, could you help us by running up to London 
and--""  
  
""For the day?"" he interrupted.  
  
""No.  It may be an affair of three or four days.""  
  
""Then I must refuse.  I am sorry, but--""  
  
""Don't apologize, Mr. Harbord,"" said the little man, cheerfully.  
""I  
shall have to find some one else, that is all."" ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"We walked into the breakfast-room, and a few minutes later Ransome
  
appeared with a great bundle of letters and telegrams in his hand.
  
He said not a word to any of us, but dropped into a chair, tearing
  
open the envelopes and glancing at their contents.  His face grew
  
darker as he read, and once he thumped his hand upon the table 
with a  
crash that set the china jingling.  
  
""Well, Inspector?"" he said at last.  
  
The little detective's head shook out a negative.  
  
""Perhaps you require an incentive,"" he sneered.  ""Is it a matter 
of a  
reward?""  
  
""No, Mr. Ransome; but it is becoming one of my personal 
reputation.""  
  
""Then, by thunder, you are in danger of losing it.  Why don't you 
and  
your friend hustle instead of loitering around as if you were paid
 by  
the job?  I tell you, man, there are thousands, hundreds of 
thousands  
melting, slipping through our fingers, every hour of the day.""  
  
He sprang from his seat and started his walk again, up and down, 
up  
and down, as we had first seen him.  
  
""Shall you be returning to London?""  
  
At the question the manager halted in his stride, staring sharply
  
down into the Inspector's bland countenance.  
  
""No,"" he said; ""I shall stay here, Mr. Addington Peace, until such
  
time as you have something definite to tell me.""  
  
""I have an inquiry to make which I would rather place in the hands
 of  
some one who has personal knowledge of Mr. Ford.  Neither Mr. 
Harbord  
nor yourself desire to leave Meudon.  Is there any one else you 
can  
suggest?""  
  
""There is Jackson, Ford's valet,"" said the manager, after a 
moment's  
thought.  ""He can go if you think him bright enough.  I'll send 
for  
him."" ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"While the footman who answered the bell was gone upon his errand 
we  
waited in an uneasy silence.  There was the shadow of an ugly 
mystery  
upon us all.  Jackson, as he entered, was the only one who seemed 
at  
his ease.  He stood there, a tall figure of all the 
respectabilities.  
  
""The Inspector here wishes you to go to London, Jackson,"" said the
  
manager.  ""He will explain the details.  There is a fast train 
from  
Camdon at eleven.""  
  
""Certainly, sir.  Do I return to-night?""  
  
""No, Jackson,"" said Peace.  ""It will take a day or two.""  
  
The man took a couple of steps toward the door, hesitated, and 
then  
returned to his former place.  
  
""I beg your pardon, sir,"" he began, addressing Ransome.  ""But I 
would  
rather remain at Meudon under present circumstances.""  
  
""What on earth do you mean?"" thundered the manager.  
  
""Well, sir, I was the last to see Mr. Ford.  There is, as it were,
 a  
suspicion upon me.  I should like to be present while the search  
continues, both for his sake--and my own.""  
  
""Very kind of you, I'm sure,"" growled Ransome.  ""But you either do
  
what I tell you, Jackson, or you pack your boxes and clear out.  
So  
be quick and make up your mind.""  
  
""I think you are treating me most unfairly, sir.  But I can not be
  
persuaded out of what I know to be my duty.""  
  
""You impertinent rascal!--"" began the furious manager.  But Peace 
was  
already on his feet with a chubby hand outstretched.  
  
""Perhaps, after all, I can make other arrangements, Mr. Ransome,"" 
he  
said.  ""It is natural that Jackson should consider his own 
reputation  
in this affair.  That is all, Jackson; you may go now."" ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"It was half an hour afterward, when the end of breakfast had  
dispersed the party, that I spoke to Peace about it, offering to 
go  
to London myself and do my best to carry out his instructions.  
  
""I had bad luck in my call for volunteers,"" he said.  
  
""I should have thought they would have been glad enough to get the
  
chance of work.  They can find no particular amusement in loafing
  
about the place all day.""  
  
""Doubtless they all had excellent reasons,"" he said with a smile.
  
""But, anyway, you can not be spared, Mr. Phillips.""  
  
""You flatter me.""  
  
""I want you to stay in your bedroom.  Write, read, do what you 
like,  
but keep your door ajar.  If any one passes down the corridor, see
  
where he goes, only don't let him know that you are watching him 
if  
you can help it.  I will take my turn at half-past one.  I don't 
mean  
to starve you.""";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"I obeyed.  After all, it was, in a manner, promotion that the  
Inspector had given me; yet it was a tedious, anxious time.  No 
one  
came my way, barring a sour-looking housemaid.  I tried to argue 
out  
the case, but the deeper I got the more conflicting grew my 
theories.  
I was never more glad to see a friendly face than when the little 
man  
came in upon me.  
  
The short winter's afternoon crept on, the Inspector and I taking
  
turn and turn about in our sentry duty.  Dinner-time came and 
went.  ";0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0
"I had been off duty from nine, but at ten-thirty I poured out a  
whisky and soda and went back to join him.  He was sitting in the
  
middle of the room smoking a pipe in great apparent satisfaction.
  
  
""Bed-time, isn't it?"" I grumbled, sniffing at his strong tobacco.
  
  
""Oh, no,"" he said.  ""The fact is, we are going to sit up all 
night.""  
  
I threw myself on a couch by the window without reply.  Perhaps I 
was  
not in the best of tempers; certainly I did not feel so.  
  
""You insisted on coming down with me,"" he suggested.  
  
""I know all about that,"" I told him.  ""I haven't complained, have 
I?  
If you want me to shut myself up for a week I'll do it; but I 
should  
prefer to have some idea of the reason why.""  
  
""I don't wish to create mysteries, Mr. Phillips,"" he said kindly;
  
""but believe me there is nothing to be gained in vague 
discussions.""  
  
I knew that settled it as far as he was concerned, so I nodded my
  
head and filled a pipe.  At eleven he walked across the room and  
switched off the light.  
  
""If nothing happens you can take your turn in four hours from 
now,""  
he said.  ""In the meanwhile get to sleep.  I will keep the first  
watch.""  
  
I shut my eyes, but there was no rest in me that night.  I lay  
listening to the silence of the old house with a dull speculation.
  
Somewhere far down in the lower floor a great gong-like clock 
chimed  
the hours and quarters.  I heard them every one, from twelve to 
one,  
from one to two.  Peace had stopped smoking.  He sat as silent as 
a  
cat at a mousehole.";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"It must have been some fifteen minutes after two that I heard the
  
faint, faint creak of a board in the corridor outside.  I sat up,
  
every nerve strung to a tense alertness.  And then there came a 
sound  
I knew well, the soft drawing touch of a hand groping in the 
darkness  
as some one felt his way along the paneled walls.  It passed us 
and  
was gone.  Yet Peace never moved.  Could he have fallen asleep?  I
  
whispered his name.  
  
""Hush!""  
  
The answer came to me like a gentle sigh.  
  
One minute, two minutes more and the room sprang into sight under 
the  
steady glow of an electric hand-lamp.  The Inspector rose from his
  
seat and slid through the door with me upon his heels.  The light 
he  
carried searched the clustered shadows; but the corridor was 
empty,  
nor was there any place where a man might hide.  
  
""You waited too long,"" I whispered impatiently.  
  
""The man is no fool, Mr. Phillips.  Do you imagine that he was not
  
listening and staring like a hunted beast?  A noisy board, a 
stumble,  
or a flash of light, and we should have wasted a tiring day.""  
  
""Nevertheless he has got clear away.""  
  
""I think not.""  
  
As we crept forward I saw that a strip of the oak flooring along 
the  
walls was gray with dust.  If it had been in such a neglected 
state  
in the afternoon I should surely have noticed it.  In some 
curiosity  
I stooped to examine the phenomenon.  
  
""Flour,"" whispered the little man touching my shoulder.  
  
""Flour?""  
  
""Yes.  I sprinkled it myself.  Look--there is the first result.""  
  
He steadied his light as he spoke, pointing with his other hand.  
On  
the powdery surface was the half footprint of a man.  
  
The flour did not extend more than a couple of feet from the 
walls,  
so that it was only here and there that we caught up the trail.  
We  
had passed the bedroom on the left--yet the footprints still went 
on;  
we were at the store-room door, yet they still were visible before
  
us.  There was no other egress from the corridor.  The tall window
 at  
the end was, as I knew, a good twenty feet from the ground.  Had 
this  
man also vanished off the earth like Silas Ford?  
  
Suddenly the inspector stopped, grasping my arm.  The light he 
held  
fell upon two footprints close together.  They were at right 
angles  
to the passage.  Apparently the man had passed into the solid 
wall!  
  
""Peace, what does this mean?""  
  
You, sir, sitting peaceably at home, with a good light and an easy
  
conscience, may think I was a timid fool; yet I was 
afraid--honestly  
and openly afraid.  The little detective heard the news of it in 
my  
voice, for he gave me a reassuring pat upon the back.  
  
""Have you never heard of a 'priest's hole'?"" he whispered.  ""In 
the  
days when Meudon Hall was built, no country house was without its
  
hiding-place.  Protestants and priests, Royalists and Republicans,
  
they all used the secret burrow at one time or another.""  
  
""How did he get in?""  
  
""That is what we are here to discover, and as I have no wish to  
destroy Mr. Ford's old oak panels I think our simplest plan will 
be  
to wait until he comes back again.""  
  
The shadows leaped upon us as Peace extinguished the light he  
carried.  The great window alone was luminous with the faint  
starlight that showed the tracery of its ancient stonework; for 
the  
rest, the darkness hedged us about in impenetrable barriers.  Side
 by  
side, we stood by the wall in which we knew the secret entrance 
must  
exist. ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"It may have been ten minutes or more when from the  
distance--somewhere below our feet, or so it seemed to me--there 
came  
the faint echo of a closing door.  It was only in such cold 
silence  
that we could have heard it.  The time ticked on.  Suddenly, upon 
the  
black of the floor, there shone a thin reflection like the slash 
of a  
sword--a reflection that grew into a broad gush of light as the  
sliding panel in the wall, six feet from where we stood, rose to 
the  
full opening.  There followed another pause, during which I could 
see  
Peace draw himself together as if for some unusual exertion.  
  
A shadow darkened the reflection on the floor, and a head came  
peering out.  The light but half displayed the face, but I could 
see  
that the teeth were bare and glistening, like those of a man in 
some  
deadly expectation.  The next moment he stepped across the 
threshold.  
With a spring like the rush of a terrier, Addington Peace was upon
  
him, driving him off his balance with the impact of the blow.  
Before  
I could reach them, the little detective had him down, though he  
still kicked viciously until I lent a hand.  The click of the  
handcuffs on his wrist ended the matter.  
  
It was Ford's valet, the man Jackson. ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"We were not long by ourselves.  I heard a key turned in the lock, 
and  
Ransome burst out of his room into the corridor like an angry 
bull.  
Almost at the same moment there sounded a quick patter of naked 
feet  
from behind us, and Harbord, the secretary, came running up, 
swinging  
a heavy stick in his hand.  They both stopped at the edge of the  
patch of light in which we were, staring from us to the gaping 
hole  
in the wall.  
  
""What in thunder are you about?"" cried the manager.  
  
""Finding a solution to your problem,"" said the little detective,  
getting to his feet.  ""Perhaps, gentlemen, you will be good enough
 to  
follow me.""";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"He stepped through the opening in the wall, and lifted the candle
  
which the valet had placed on the floor while he was raising the  
panel from within.  By its light I could see the first steps of a
  
flight which led down into darkness.  
  
""We will take Jackson with us,"" he continued.  ""Keep an eye on 
him,  
Mr. Phillips, if you please.""  
  
It was a strange procession that we made.  First Peace, with the  
candle, then Ransome, with the valet, following, while I and 
Harbord  
brought up the rear.  We descended some thirty steps, formed in 
the  
thickness of the wall, opened a heavy door, and so found ourselves
 in  
a narrow chamber, some twelve feet long by seven broad.  Upon a  
mattress at the further end lay a man, gagged and bound.  As the  
light fell upon his features, Ransome sprang forward, shouting his
  
name.  
  
""Silas Ford, by thunder!""  
  
With eager fingers we loosened the gag and cut the ropes that 
bound  
his wrists.  He sat up, turning his long, thin face from one to 
the  
other of us as he stretched the cramp from his limbs.  
  
""Thank you, gentlemen,"" said he.  ""Well, Ransome, how are things?""
  
  
""Bad, sir; but it's not too late.""  
  
He nodded his head, passing his hands through his hair with a 
quick,  
nervous movement.  
  
""You've caught my clever friend, I see.  Kindly go through his  
pockets, will you?  He has something I must ask him to return to 
me.""  
  
We found it in Jackson's pocket-book--a check, antedated a week, 
for  
five thousand pounds, with a covering letter to the manager of the
  
bank.  Ford took the bit of stamped paper, twisting it to and fro 
in  
his supple fingers.  
  
""It was smart of you, Jackson,"" he said, addressing the bowed 
figure  
before him: ""I give you credit for the idea.  To kidnap a man just
 as  
he was bringing off a big deal--well, you would have earned the  
money.""  
  
""But how did you get down here?"" struck in the manager.  
  
""He told me that he had discovered an old hiding-place--a 
'priest's  
hole,' he called it--and I walked into the trap as the best man 
may  
do sometimes.  As we got to the bottom of that stairway he slipped
 a  
sack over my head and had me fixed in thirty seconds.  He fed me  
himself twice a day, standing by to see I didn't halloo.  When I 
paid  
up he was to have twenty-four hours' start; then he would let you
  
know where I was.  I held out awhile, but I gave in to-night.  The
  
delay was getting too dangerous.  Have you a cigarette, Harbord?  
Thank you.  And who may you be?""  
  
It was to the detective he spoke.  
  
""My name is Peace, Inspector Addington Peace, from Scotland Yard.""
  
  
""And I owe my rescue to you?""  
  
The little man bowed.  
  
""You will have no reason to regret it.  And what did they think 
had  
become of me, Inspector?""  
  
""It was the general opinion that you had taken to yourself wings, 
Mr.  
Ford.""";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"It was as we traveled up to town next day that Peace told me his  
story.  I will set it down as briefly as may be.  
  
""I soon came to the conclusion that Ford, whether dead or alive, 
was  
inside the grounds of Meudon Hall.  If he had bolted, for some  
reason, by the way, which was perfectly incomprehensible, a man of
  
his ability would not have left a broad trail across the centre of
  
his lawn for all to see.  There was, moreover, no trace of him 
that  
our men could ferret out at any station within reasonable 
distance.  
A motor was possible, but there were no marks of its presence next
  
morning in the mud of the roads.  That fact I learned from a 
curious  
groom who had aided in the search, and who, with a similar idea 
upon  
him, had carefully examined the highway at daybreak.  
  
""When I clambered to the top of the wall I found that the snow 
upon  
the coping had been dislodged.  I traced the marks, as you saw, 
for  
about a dozen yards.  Where they ended I, too, dropped to the 
ground  
outside.  There I made a remarkable discovery.  Upon a little 
drift  
of snow that lay in the shallow ditch beneath were more 
footprints.  
But they were not those of Ford.  They were the marks of long and
  
narrow boots, which led into the road, where they were lost in the
  
track of a flock of sheep that had been driven over it the day 
before.  
  
""I took a careful measurement of those footprints.  They might, of
  
course, belong to some private investigator; but they gave me an  
idea.  Could some man have walked across the lawn in Ford's boots,
  
changed them to his own on the top of the wall, and so departed?  
Was  
it the desire of someone to let it be supposed that Ford had run 
away?  
  
""When I examined Ford's private rooms I was even more fortunate.  
From the boot-boy I discovered that the master had three pairs of
  
shooting boots.  There were three pairs in the stand.  Some one 
had  
made a very serious mistake.  Instead of hiding the pair he had 
used  
on the lawn, he had returned them to their place.  The trick was  
becoming evident.  But where was Ford?  In the house or grounds, 
dead  
or alive, but where?  
  
""I was able, through my friend the boot-boy, to examine the boots 
on  
the night of our arrival.  My measurements corresponded with those
  
that Jackson, the valet, wore.  Was he acting for himself, or was
  
Harbord, or even Ransome, in the secret?  That, too, it was 
necessary  
to discover before I showed my hand.  
  
""Your story of Harbord's midnight excursion supplied a clue.  The
  
secretary had evidently followed some man who had disappeared  
mysteriously.  Could there be the entrance to a secret chamber in
  
that corridor?  That would explain the mystification of Harbord as
  
well as the disappearance of Silas Ford.  If so, Harbord was not  
involved.  
  
""If Ford were held a prisoner he must be fed.  His jailer must of
  
necessity remain in the house.  But the trap I set in the 
suggested  
journey to town was an experiment singularly unsuccessful, for all
  
the three men I desired to test refused.  However, if I were right
  
about the secret chamber I could checkmate the blackmailer by 
keeping  
a watch on him from your room, which commanded the line of  
communications.  But Jackson was clever enough to leave his  
victualing to the night-time.  I scattered the flour to try the  
result of that ancient trick.  It was successful.  That is all.  
Do  
you follow me?""  
  
""Yes,"" said I; ""but how did Jackson come to know the secret hiding
  
place?""  
  
""He has long been a servant of the house.  You had better ask his 
old  
master."" ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0

"I, James Phillips, stood with my back to the fire, smoking and  
puzzling over it.  It was worth all the headlines the newspapers 
had  
given it; there was no loophole to the mystery.  
  
Both sides of the Atlantic knew Silas J. Ford.  He had established
 a  
business reputation in America that had made him a celebrity in  
England from the day he stepped off the liner.  Once in London his
  
syndicates and companies and consolidations had startled the  
slow-moving British mind.  The commercial sky of the United 
Kingdom  
was overshadowed by him and his schemes.  The papers were full of
  
praise and blame, of puffs and denunciations.  He was a 
millionaire;  
he was on the verge of a smash that would paralyze the markets of 
the  
world.  He was an abstainer, a drunkard, a gambler, a most 
religious  
man.  He was a confirmed bachelor, a woman hater; his engagement 
was  
to be announced shortly.  So was the gossip kept rolling with the
  
limelight always centred upon the spot where Silas J. Ford 
happened  
to be standing.  
  
And now he had disappeared, vanished, evaporated.  
  
On the night of December 18, a Thursday, he had left London for  
Meudon Hall, the fine old Hampshire mansion that he had rented 
from  
Lord Beverley.  The two most trusted men in his office accompanied
  
him.  Friday morning he had spent with them; but at three o'clock 
the  
pair had returned to London, leaving their chief behind.  From 
four  
to seven he had been shut up with his secretary.  It was a hard 
time  
for every one, a time verging upon panic, and at such times Silas 
J.  
Ford was not an idle man.  
  
At eight o'clock he had dined.  His one recreation was music, and
  
after the meal he had played the organ in the picture gallery for 
an  
hour.  At a quarter past eleven he retired to his bedroom, 
dismissing  
Jackson, his body servant, for the night.  Three-quarters of an 
hour  
later, however, Harbord, his secretary, had been called to the  
private telephone, for Mr. Ford had brought an extension wire from
  
the neighboring town of Camdon.  It was a London message, and so  
urgent that he decided to wake his chief.  There was no answer to 
his  
knock, and on entering the room he found that Mr. Ford was not in
  
bed.  He was surprised, but in no way suspicious, and started to  
search the house.  He was joined by a footman, and, a little 
later,  
by Jackson and the butler.  Astonishment changed to alarm.  Other
  
servants were roused to aid in the quest.  Finally, a party, 
provided  
with lanterns from the stables, commenced to examine the grounds.
  
  
Snow had fallen early in the day, covering the great lawns in 
front  
of the entrance porch with a soft white blanket, about an inch in
  
thickness.  It was the head groom who struck the trail.  
Apparently  
Mr. Ford had walked out of the porch, and so over the drive and  
across the lawn toward the wall that bounded the public road.  
This  
road, which led from Meudon village to the town of Camdon, crossed
  
the front of Meudon Hall at a distance of some quarter of a mile.
  
  
There was no doubt as to the identity of the footprints, for Silas
  
Ford affected a broad, square-toed boot, easily recognizable from 
its  
unusual impression.  
  
They tracked him by their lanterns to the park wall, and there all
  
trace of him disappeared.  The wall was of rough stone, easily  
surmountable by an active man.  The snow that covered the road  
outside had been churned into muddy paste by the traffic of the 
day;  
there were no further footprints observable.  
  
The party returned to the house in great bewilderment.  The 
telephone  
to London brought no explanation, and the following morning Mr.  
Harbord caught the first train to town to make inquiries.  For  
private reasons his friends did not desire publicity for the 
affair,  
and it was not until the late afternoon, when all their  
investigations had proved fruitless, that they communicated with  
Scotland Yard.  When the papers went to press the whereabouts of 
the  
great Mr. Ford still remained a mystery.  
  
In keen curiosity I set off up the stairs to Inspector Peace's 
room.  
Perhaps the little detective had later news to give me.  
  
I found him standing with his back to the fire puffing at his  
cigarette with a plump solemnity.  A bag, neatly shaped, lay on 
the  
rug at his feet.  He nodded a welcome, watching me over his 
glasses.  
  
""I expected you, Mr. Phillips,"" he said.  ""And how do you explain 
it?""  
  
""A love affair or temporary insanity,"" I suggested vaguely.  
  
""Surely we can combine those solutions,"" he smiled.  ""Anything 
else?""  
  
""No.  I came to ask your opinion.""  
  
""My mind is void of theories, Mr. Phillips, and I shall endeavor 
to  
keep it so for the present.  If you wish to amuse yourself by  
discussing possibilities, I would suggest your consideration of 
the  
reason why, if he wanted to disappear quietly, he should leave so
  
obvious a track through the snow of his own lawn.  For myself, as 
I  
am leaving for Camdon via Waterloo Station in ten minutes, I shall
  
hope for more definite data before night.""  
  
""Peace,"" I asked him eagerly, ""may I come with you?""  
  
""If you can be ready in time,"" he said.  
  
It was past two o'clock when we arrived at the old town of Camdon.
  A  
carriage met us at the station.  Five minutes more and we were 
clear  
of the narrow streets and climbing the first bare ridge of the 
downs.  
It was a desolate prospect enough--a bare expanse of wind-swept 
land  
that rose and fell with the sweeping regularity of the Pacific 
swell.  
Here and there a clump of ragged firs showed black against the 
snow.  
Under that gentle carpet the crisp turf of the crests and the 
broad  
plow lands of the lower ground alike lay hidden.  I shivered, 
drawing  
my coat more closely about me.  
  
It was half an hour later that we topped a swelling rise and saw 
the  
gray towers of the ancient mansion beneath us.  In the shelter of 
the  
valley by the quiet river, that now lay frozen into silence, the  
trees had grown into splendid woodlands, circling the hall on the
  
further side.  From the broad front the white lawns crept down to 
the  
road on which we were driving.  Dark masses of shrubberies and the
  
tracery of scattered trees broke their silent curves.  The park 
wall  
that fenced them from the road stood out like an ink line ruled 
upon  
paper.  
  
""It must have been there that he disappeared,"" I cried, with a  
speculative finger.  
  
""So I imagine,"" said Peace.  ""And if he has spent two nights on 
the  
Hampshire downs, he will be looking for a fire to-day.  You have  
rather more than your fair share of the rug, Mr. Phillips, if you
  
will excuse my mentioning it.""  
  
A man was standing on the steps of the entrance porch when we 
drove  
up.  As we unrolled ourselves he stepped forward to help us.  He 
was  
a thin, pale-faced fellow, with fair hair and indeterminate eyes.
  
  
""My name is Harbord,"" he said.  ""You are Inspector Addington 
Peace, I  
believe.""  
  
His hand shook as he stretched it out in a tremulous greeting.  
Plainly the secretary was afraid, visibly and anxiously afraid.  
  
""Mr. Ransome, the manager of Mr. Ford's London office, is here,"" 
he  
continued.  ""He is waiting to see you in the library.""  
  
We followed him through a great hall into a room lined with books
  
from floor to ceiling.  A stout, dark man, who was pacing it like 
a  
beast in a cage, stopped at the sight of us.  His face, as he 
turned  
it toward us, looked pinched and gray in the full light.  
  
""Inspector Peace, eh?"" he said.  ""Well, Inspector, if you want a  
reward, name it.  If you want to pull the house down, only say the
  
word.  But find him for us, or, by heaven, we're done.""  
  
""Is it as bad as that?""  
  
""You can keep a secret, I suppose.  Yes--it couldn't well be 
worse.  
It was a tricky time; he hid half his schemes in his own head; he
  
never trusted even me altogether.  If he were dead I could plan  
something, but now--""  
  
He thumped his hand on the table and turned away to the window.  
  
""When you last saw Mr. Ford was he in good health?  Did he stand 
the  
strain?""  
  
""Ford had no nerves.  He was never better in his life.""  
  
""In these great transactions he would have his enemies.  If his 
plans  
succeeded there would be many hard hit, perhaps ruined.  Have you 
any  
suspicion of a man who, to save himself, might make away with Mr.
  
Ford?""  
  
""No,"" said the manager after a moment's thought.  ""No, I can not 
give  
you a single name.  The players are all big men, Inspector.  I 
don't  
say that their consciences would stop them from trying such a 
trick,  
but it wouldn't be worth their while.  They hold off when jail is 
the  
certain punishment.""  
  
""Was this financial crisis in his own affairs generally known?""  
  
""Certainly not.""  
  
""Who would know of it?""  
  
""There might be a dozen men on both sides of the Atlantic who 
would  
suspect the truth.  But I don't suppose that more than four people
  
were actually in possession of the facts.""  
  
""And who would they be?""  
  
""His two partners in America, myself, and Mr. Harbord there.""  
  
Peace turned to the young man with a smile and a polite bow.  
  
""Can you add any names to the list?"" he asked.  
  
""No,"" said Harbord, staring at the detective with a puzzled look, 
as  
if trying to catch the drift of his questions.  
  
""Thank you,"" said the Inspector; ""and now will you show me the 
place  
where this curious disappearance occurred?""  
  
We crossed the drive, where the snow lay torn and trampled by the
  
carriages, and so to the white, even surface of the lawn.  We soon
  
struck the trail, a confused path beaten by many footprints.  
Peace  
stooped for a moment, and then turned to the secretary with an 
angry  
glance.  
  
""Were you with them?"" he said.  
  
""Yes.""  
  
""Then why, in the name of common sense, didn't you keep them off 
his  
tracks?  You have simply trampled them out of existence, between 
you.""  
  
""We were in a hurry, Inspector,"" said the secretary meekly.  ""We  
didn't think about it.""  
  
We walked forward, following the broad trail until we came to a  
circular patch of trodden snow.  Evidently the searchers had 
stopped  
and stood talking together.  On the further side I saw the 
footprints  
of a man plainly defined.  There were some half-dozen clear  
impressions and they ended at the base of the old wall, which was
  
some six feet in height.  
  
""I am glad to see that you and your friends have left me 
something,  
Mr. Harbord,"" said the Inspector.  
  
He stepped forward and, kneeling down, examined the nearest 
footprint.  
  
""Mr. Ford dressed for dinner?"" he inquired, glancing up at the  
secretary.  
  
""Certainly!  Why do you ask?""  
  
""Merely that he had on heavy shooting boots when he took this 
evening  
stroll.  It will be interesting to discover what clothes he wore.""
  
  
The Inspector walked up to the wall, moving parallel to the tracks
 in  
the snow.  With singular activity for his plump and unathletic 
figure  
he climbed to the top and seated himself while he stared about 
him.  
Then on his hands and knees he began to crawl forward along the  
coping.  It was a quaint spectacle, but the extraordinary care and
  
vigilance of the little man took the farce out of it.  
  
Presently he stopped and looked down at us with a gentle smile.  
  
""Please stay where you are,"" he said, and disappeared on the 
further  
side.  
  
Harbord offered me a cigarette, and we waited with due obedience 
till  
the Inspector's bullet-head again broke the horizon as he 
struggled  
back to his position on the coping of the wall.  
  
He seemed in a very pleasant temper when he joined us; but he said
  
nothing of his discoveries, and I had grown too wise to inquire.  
When we reached the entrance hall he asked for Jackson, the valet,
  
and in a couple of minutes the man appeared.  He was a tall,  
hatchet-faced fellow, very neatly dressed in black.  He made a 
little  
bow, and then stood watching us in a most respectful attitude.  
  
""A queer business this, Jackson,"" said Addington Peace.  
  
""Yes, sir.""  
  
""And what is your opinion on it?""  
  
""To be frank, sir, I thought at first that Mr. Ford had run away; 
but  
now I don't know what to make of it.""  
  
""And why should he run away?""  
  
""I have no idea, sir; but he seemed to me rather strange in his  
manner yesterday.""  
  
""Have you been with him long?""  
  
""No, sir.  I was valet to the Honorable John Dorn, Lord Beverley's
  
second son.  Mr. Ford took me from Mr. Dorn at the time he rented 
the  
Hall.""  
  
""I see.  And now will you show me your master's room?  I shall see
  
you again later, Mr. Harbord,"" he continued; ""in the meanwhile I 
will  
leave my assistant with you.""  
  
We sat and smoked in the secretary's room.  He was not much of a  
talker, consuming cigarette after cigarette in silence.  The 
winter  
dusk had already fallen when the Inspector joined us, and we 
retired  
to our rooms to prepare for dinner.  I tried a word with Peace 
upon  
the staircase, but he shook his head and walked on.  
  
The meal dragged itself to an end somehow, and we left Ransome 
with a  
second decanter of port before him.  Peace slipped away again, and
 I  
consoled myself with a book in the library until half-past ten, 
when  
I walked off to bed.  A servant was switching off the light in the
  
hall when I mounted the great staircase.  
  
My room was in the old wing at the further side of the picture  
gallery, and I had some difficulty in steering my way through the
  
dark corridors.  The mystery that hung over the house had shaken 
my  
nerves, and I remember that I started at every creak of a board 
and  
peered into the shadows as I passed along with, Heaven knows, what
  
ghostly expectations.  I was glad enough to close my door upon 
them  
and see the wood fire blazing cheerfully in the open hearth.  
  
. . . . . . . . . . . .  
  
I woke with a start that left me sitting up in bed, with my heart
  
thumping in my ribs like a piston rod.  I am not generally a light
  
sleeper, but that night, even while I snored, my nerves were 
active.  
Some one had tapped at my door--that was my impression.  
  
I listened with the uncertain fear that comes to the newly waked.
  
Then I heard it again--on the wall near my head this time.  A 
board  
creaked.  Some one was groping his way down the dark corridor  
without.  Presently he stopped, and a faint line of illumination  
sprang out under my door.  It winked, and then grew still.  He had
  
lighted a candle.  
  
Assurance came with the streak of light.  What was he doing, 
groping  
in the dark, if he had a candle with him?  I crept over to the 
door,  
opened it, and stared cautiously out.  
  
About a dozen feet away a man was standing, a striking figure 
against  
the light he carried.  His back was toward me, but I could see 
that  
his hand was shading the candle from his eyes while he stared into
  
the shadows that clung about the further end of the corridor.  
  
Presently he began to move forward.  
  
The picture gallery and the body of the house lay behind.  The  
corridor in which he stood terminated in a window, set deep into 
the  
stone of the old walls.  The man walked slowly, throwing the light
 to  
right and left.  His attitude was of nervous expectation--that of 
a  
man who looked for something that he feared to see.  
  
At the window he stopped, staring about him and listening.  He  
examined the fastenings, and then tried a door on his right.  It 
was  
locked against him.  As he did so I caught his profile against the
  
light.  It was Harbord, the secretary.  From where I stood he was 
not  
more than forty feet away.  There was no possibility of a mistake.
  
  
As he turned to come back I retreated into my room, closing the 
door.  
The fellow was in a state of great agitation, and I could hear him
  
muttering to himself as he walked.  When he had passed by I peeped
  
out to see him and his light dwindle, reach the corner by the 
picture  
gallery, and fade into a reflection, a darkness.  
  
I took care to turn the key before I got back into bed.  
  
I woke again at seven, and, hurrying on my clothes, set off to 
tell  
Peace all about it.  I took him to the place, and together we  
examined the corridor.  There were only two rooms beyond mine.  
The  
one on the left was occupied by Ransome; that on the right was a  
large store-room, the door of which was locked.  The housekeeper 
kept  
the key, we learned upon inquiry.  Whom had Harbord followed?  The
  
problem was beyond me.  As for Inspector Peace, he did not indulge
 in  
verbal speculations.  
  
It was in the central hall that we encountered the secretary on 
his  
way to the breakfast-room.  The man looked nervous and depressed; 
he  
nodded to us and was passing on, when Peace stopped him.  
  
""Good-morning, Mr. Harbord,"" he said.  ""Can I have a word with 
you?""  
  
""Certainly, Inspector.  What is it?""  
  
""I have a favor to ask.  My assistant and myself have our hands 
full  
here.  If necessary, could you help us by running up to London 
and--""  
  
""For the day?"" he interrupted.  
  
""No.  It may be an affair of three or four days.""  
  
""Then I must refuse.  I am sorry, but--""  
  
""Don't apologize, Mr. Harbord,"" said the little man, cheerfully.  
""I  
shall have to find some one else, that is all.""  
  
We walked into the breakfast-room, and a few minutes later Ransome
  
appeared with a great bundle of letters and telegrams in his hand.
  
He said not a word to any of us, but dropped into a chair, tearing
  
open the envelopes and glancing at their contents.  His face grew
  
darker as he read, and once he thumped his hand upon the table 
with a  
crash that set the china jingling.  
  
""Well, Inspector?"" he said at last.  
  
The little detective's head shook out a negative.  
  
""Perhaps you require an incentive,"" he sneered.  ""Is it a matter 
of a  
reward?""  
  
""No, Mr. Ransome; but it is becoming one of my personal 
reputation.""  
  
""Then, by thunder, you are in danger of losing it.  Why don't you 
and  
your friend hustle instead of loitering around as if you were paid
 by  
the job?  I tell you, man, there are thousands, hundreds of 
thousands  
melting, slipping through our fingers, every hour of the day.""  
  
He sprang from his seat and started his walk again, up and down, 
up  
and down, as we had first seen him.  
  
""Shall you be returning to London?""  
  
At the question the manager halted in his stride, staring sharply
  
down into the Inspector's bland countenance.  
  
""No,"" he said; ""I shall stay here, Mr. Addington Peace, until such
  
time as you have something definite to tell me.""  
  
""I have an inquiry to make which I would rather place in the hands
 of  
some one who has personal knowledge of Mr. Ford.  Neither Mr. 
Harbord  
nor yourself desire to leave Meudon.  Is there any one else you 
can  
suggest?""  
  
""There is Jackson, Ford's valet,"" said the manager, after a 
moment's  
thought.  ""He can go if you think him bright enough.  I'll send 
for  
him.""  
  
While the footman who answered the bell was gone upon his errand 
we  
waited in an uneasy silence.  There was the shadow of an ugly 
mystery  
upon us all.  Jackson, as he entered, was the only one who seemed 
at  
his ease.  He stood there, a tall figure of all the 
respectabilities.  
  
""The Inspector here wishes you to go to London, Jackson,"" said the
  
manager.  ""He will explain the details.  There is a fast train 
from  
Camdon at eleven.""  
  
""Certainly, sir.  Do I return to-night?""  
  
""No, Jackson,"" said Peace.  ""It will take a day or two.""  
  
The man took a couple of steps toward the door, hesitated, and 
then  
returned to his former place.  
  
""I beg your pardon, sir,"" he began, addressing Ransome.  ""But I 
would  
rather remain at Meudon under present circumstances.""  
  
""What on earth do you mean?"" thundered the manager.  
  
""Well, sir, I was the last to see Mr. Ford.  There is, as it were,
 a  
suspicion upon me.  I should like to be present while the search  
continues, both for his sake--and my own.""  
  
""Very kind of you, I'm sure,"" growled Ransome.  ""But you either do
  
what I tell you, Jackson, or you pack your boxes and clear out.  
So  
be quick and make up your mind.""  
  
""I think you are treating me most unfairly, sir.  But I can not be
  
persuaded out of what I know to be my duty.""  
  
""You impertinent rascal!--"" began the furious manager.  But Peace 
was  
already on his feet with a chubby hand outstretched.  
  
""Perhaps, after all, I can make other arrangements, Mr. Ransome,"" 
he  
said.  ""It is natural that Jackson should consider his own 
reputation  
in this affair.  That is all, Jackson; you may go now.""  
  
It was half an hour afterward, when the end of breakfast had  
dispersed the party, that I spoke to Peace about it, offering to 
go  
to London myself and do my best to carry out his instructions.  
  
""I had bad luck in my call for volunteers,"" he said.  
  
""I should have thought they would have been glad enough to get the
  
chance of work.  They can find no particular amusement in loafing
  
about the place all day.""  
  
""Doubtless they all had excellent reasons,"" he said with a smile.
  
""But, anyway, you can not be spared, Mr. Phillips.""  
  
""You flatter me.""  
  
""I want you to stay in your bedroom.  Write, read, do what you 
like,  
but keep your door ajar.  If any one passes down the corridor, see
  
where he goes, only don't let him know that you are watching him 
if  
you can help it.  I will take my turn at half-past one.  I don't 
mean  
to starve you.""  
  
I obeyed.  After all, it was, in a manner, promotion that the  
Inspector had given me; yet it was a tedious, anxious time.  No 
one  
came my way, barring a sour-looking housemaid.  I tried to argue 
out  
the case, but the deeper I got the more conflicting grew my 
theories.  
I was never more glad to see a friendly face than when the little 
man  
came in upon me.  
  
The short winter's afternoon crept on, the Inspector and I taking
  
turn and turn about in our sentry duty.  Dinner-time came and 
went.  
I had been off duty from nine, but at ten-thirty I poured out a  
whisky and soda and went back to join him.  He was sitting in the
  
middle of the room smoking a pipe in great apparent satisfaction.
  
  
""Bed-time, isn't it?"" I grumbled, sniffing at his strong tobacco.
  
  
""Oh, no,"" he said.  ""The fact is, we are going to sit up all 
night.""  
  
I threw myself on a couch by the window without reply.  Perhaps I 
was  
not in the best of tempers; certainly I did not feel so.  
  
""You insisted on coming down with me,"" he suggested.  
  
""I know all about that,"" I told him.  ""I haven't complained, have 
I?  
If you want me to shut myself up for a week I'll do it; but I 
should  
prefer to have some idea of the reason why.""  
  
""I don't wish to create mysteries, Mr. Phillips,"" he said kindly;
  
""but believe me there is nothing to be gained in vague 
discussions.""  
  
I knew that settled it as far as he was concerned, so I nodded my
  
head and filled a pipe.  At eleven he walked across the room and  
switched off the light.  
  
""If nothing happens you can take your turn in four hours from 
now,""  
he said.  ""In the meanwhile get to sleep.  I will keep the first  
watch.""  
  
I shut my eyes, but there was no rest in me that night.  I lay  
listening to the silence of the old house with a dull speculation.
  
Somewhere far down in the lower floor a great gong-like clock 
chimed  
the hours and quarters.  I heard them every one, from twelve to 
one,  
from one to two.  Peace had stopped smoking.  He sat as silent as 
a  
cat at a mousehole.  
  
It must have been some fifteen minutes after two that I heard the
  
faint, faint creak of a board in the corridor outside.  I sat up,
  
every nerve strung to a tense alertness.  And then there came a 
sound  
I knew well, the soft drawing touch of a hand groping in the 
darkness  
as some one felt his way along the paneled walls.  It passed us 
and  
was gone.  Yet Peace never moved.  Could he have fallen asleep?  I
  
whispered his name.  
  
""Hush!""  
  
The answer came to me like a gentle sigh.  
  
One minute, two minutes more and the room sprang into sight under 
the  
steady glow of an electric hand-lamp.  The Inspector rose from his
  
seat and slid through the door with me upon his heels.  The light 
he  
carried searched the clustered shadows; but the corridor was 
empty,  
nor was there any place where a man might hide.  
  
""You waited too long,"" I whispered impatiently.  
  
""The man is no fool, Mr. Phillips.  Do you imagine that he was not
  
listening and staring like a hunted beast?  A noisy board, a 
stumble,  
or a flash of light, and we should have wasted a tiring day.""  
  
""Nevertheless he has got clear away.""  
  
""I think not.""  
  
As we crept forward I saw that a strip of the oak flooring along 
the  
walls was gray with dust.  If it had been in such a neglected 
state  
in the afternoon I should surely have noticed it.  In some 
curiosity  
I stooped to examine the phenomenon.  
  
""Flour,"" whispered the little man touching my shoulder.  
  
""Flour?""  
  
""Yes.  I sprinkled it myself.  Look--there is the first result.""  
  
He steadied his light as he spoke, pointing with his other hand.  
On  
the powdery surface was the half footprint of a man.  
  
The flour did not extend more than a couple of feet from the 
walls,  
so that it was only here and there that we caught up the trail.  
We  
had passed the bedroom on the left--yet the footprints still went 
on;  
we were at the store-room door, yet they still were visible before
  
us.  There was no other egress from the corridor.  The tall window
 at  
the end was, as I knew, a good twenty feet from the ground.  Had 
this  
man also vanished off the earth like Silas Ford?  
  
Suddenly the inspector stopped, grasping my arm.  The light he 
held  
fell upon two footprints close together.  They were at right 
angles  
to the passage.  Apparently the man had passed into the solid 
wall!  
  
""Peace, what does this mean?"" ";0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"The little detective heard the news of it in 
my  
voice, for he gave me a reassuring pat upon the back.  
  
""Have you never heard of a 'priest's hole'?"" he whispered.  ""In 
the  
days when Meudon Hall was built, no country house was without its
  
hiding-place.  Protestants and priests, Royalists and Republicans,
  
they all used the secret burrow at one time or another.""  
  
""How did he get in?""  
  
""That is what we are here to discover, and as I have no wish to  
destroy Mr. Ford's old oak panels I think our simplest plan will 
be  
to wait until he comes back again.""  
  
The shadows leaped upon us as Peace extinguished the light he  
carried.  The great window alone was luminous with the faint  
starlight that showed the tracery of its ancient stonework; for 
the  
rest, the darkness hedged us about in impenetrable barriers.  Side
 by  
side, we stood by the wall in which we knew the secret entrance 
must  
exist.  
  
It may have been ten minutes or more when from the  
distance--somewhere below our feet, or so it seemed to me--there 
came  
the faint echo of a closing door.  It was only in such cold 
silence  
that we could have heard it.  The time ticked on.  Suddenly, upon 
the  
black of the floor, there shone a thin reflection like the slash 
of a  
sword--a reflection that grew into a broad gush of light as the  
sliding panel in the wall, six feet from where we stood, rose to 
the  
full opening.  There followed another pause, during which I could 
see  
Peace draw himself together as if for some unusual exertion.  
  
A shadow darkened the reflection on the floor, and a head came  
peering out.  The light but half displayed the face, but I could 
see  
that the teeth were bare and glistening, like those of a man in 
some  
deadly expectation.  The next moment he stepped across the 
threshold.  
With a spring like the rush of a terrier, Addington Peace was upon
  
him, driving him off his balance with the impact of the blow.  
Before  
I could reach them, the little detective had him down, though he  
still kicked viciously until I lent a hand.  The click of the  
handcuffs on his wrist ended the matter.  
  
It was Ford's valet, the man Jackson.  
  
We were not long by ourselves.  I heard a key turned in the lock, 
and  
Ransome burst out of his room into the corridor like an angry 
bull.  
Almost at the same moment there sounded a quick patter of naked 
feet  
from behind us, and Harbord, the secretary, came running up, 
swinging  
a heavy stick in his hand.  They both stopped at the edge of the  
patch of light in which we were, staring from us to the gaping 
hole  
in the wall.  
  
""What in thunder are you about?"" cried the manager.  
  
""Finding a solution to your problem,"" said the little detective,  
getting to his feet.  ""Perhaps, gentlemen, you will be good enough
 to  
follow me.""  
  
He stepped through the opening in the wall, and lifted the candle
  
which the valet had placed on the floor while he was raising the  
panel from within.  By its light I could see the first steps of a
  
flight which led down into darkness.  
  
""We will take Jackson with us,"" he continued.  ""Keep an eye on 
him,  
Mr. Phillips, if you please.""  
  
It was a strange procession that we made.  First Peace, with the  
candle, then Ransome, with the valet, following, while I and 
Harbord  
brought up the rear.  We descended some thirty steps, formed in 
the  
thickness of the wall, opened a heavy door, and so found ourselves
 in  
a narrow chamber, some twelve feet long by seven broad.  Upon a  
mattress at the further end lay a man, gagged and bound.  As the  
light fell upon his features, Ransome sprang forward, shouting his
  
name.  
  
""Silas Ford, by thunder!""  
  
With eager fingers we loosened the gag and cut the ropes that 
bound  
his wrists.  He sat up, turning his long, thin face from one to 
the  
other of us as he stretched the cramp from his limbs.  
  
""Thank you, gentlemen,"" said he.  ""Well, Ransome, how are things?""
  
  
""Bad, sir; but it's not too late.""  
  
He nodded his head, passing his hands through his hair with a 
quick,  
nervous movement.  
  
""You've caught my clever friend, I see.  Kindly go through his  
pockets, will you?  He has something I must ask him to return to 
me.""  
  
We found it in Jackson's pocket-book--a check, antedated a week, 
for  
five thousand pounds, with a covering letter to the manager of the
  
bank.  Ford took the bit of stamped paper, twisting it to and fro 
in  
his supple fingers.  
  
""It was smart of you, Jackson,"" he said, addressing the bowed 
figure  
before him: ""I give you credit for the idea.  To kidnap a man just
 as  
he was bringing off a big deal--well, you would have earned the  
money.""  
  
""But how did you get down here?"" struck in the manager.  
  
""He told me that he had discovered an old hiding-place--a 
'priest's  
hole,' he called it--and I walked into the trap as the best man 
may  
do sometimes.  As we got to the bottom of that stairway he slipped
 a  
sack over my head and had me fixed in thirty seconds.  He fed me  
himself twice a day, standing by to see I didn't halloo.  When I 
paid  
up he was to have twenty-four hours' start; then he would let you
  
know where I was.  I held out awhile, but I gave in to-night.  The
  
delay was getting too dangerous.  Have you a cigarette, Harbord?  
Thank you.  And who may you be?""  
  
It was to the detective he spoke.  
  
""My name is Peace, Inspector Addington Peace, from Scotland Yard.""
  
  
""And I owe my rescue to you?""  
  
The little man bowed.  
  
""You will have no reason to regret it.  And what did they think 
had  
become of me, Inspector?""  
  
""It was the general opinion that you had taken to yourself wings, 
Mr.  
Ford.""  
  
. . . . . . . . . . . .  
  
It was as we traveled up to town next day that Peace told me his  
story.  I will set it down as briefly as may be.  
  
""I soon came to the conclusion that Ford, whether dead or alive, 
was  
inside the grounds of Meudon Hall.  If he had bolted, for some  
reason, by the way, which was perfectly incomprehensible, a man of
  
his ability would not have left a broad trail across the centre of
  
his lawn for all to see.  There was, moreover, no trace of him 
that  
our men could ferret out at any station within reasonable 
distance.  
A motor was possible, but there were no marks of its presence next
  
morning in the mud of the roads.  That fact I learned from a 
curious  
groom who had aided in the search, and who, with a similar idea 
upon  
him, had carefully examined the highway at daybreak.  ";0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"""When I clambered to the top of the wall I found that the snow 
upon  
the coping had been dislodged.  I traced the marks, as you saw, 
for  
about a dozen yards.  Where they ended I, too, dropped to the 
ground  
outside.  There I made a remarkable discovery.  Upon a little 
drift  
of snow that lay in the shallow ditch beneath were more 
footprints.  
But they were not those of Ford.  They were the marks of long and
  
narrow boots, which led into the road, where they were lost in the
  
track of a flock of sheep that had been driven over it the day 
before.  
  
""I took a careful measurement of those footprints.  They might, of
  
course, belong to some private investigator; but they gave me an  
idea.  Could some man have walked across the lawn in Ford's boots,
  
changed them to his own on the top of the wall, and so departed?  
Was  
it the desire of someone to let it be supposed that Ford had run 
away?  
  
""When I examined Ford's private rooms I was even more fortunate.  
From the boot-boy I discovered that the master had three pairs of
  
shooting boots.  There were three pairs in the stand.  Some one 
had  
made a very serious mistake.  Instead of hiding the pair he had 
used  
on the lawn, he had returned them to their place.  The trick was  
becoming evident.  But where was Ford?  In the house or grounds, 
dead  
or alive, but where?  
  
""I was able, through my friend the boot-boy, to examine the boots 
on  
the night of our arrival.  My measurements corresponded with those
  
that Jackson, the valet, wore.  Was he acting for himself, or was
  
Harbord, or even Ransome, in the secret?  That, too, it was 
necessary  
to discover before I showed my hand.  
  
""Your story of Harbord's midnight excursion supplied a clue.  The
  
secretary had evidently followed some man who had disappeared  
mysteriously.  Could there be the entrance to a secret chamber in
  
that corridor?  That would explain the mystification of Harbord as
  
well as the disappearance of Silas Ford.  If so, Harbord was not  
involved.  
  
""If Ford were held a prisoner he must be fed.  His jailer must of
  
necessity remain in the house.  But the trap I set in the 
suggested  
journey to town was an experiment singularly unsuccessful, for all
  
the three men I desired to test refused.  However, if I were right
  
about the secret chamber I could checkmate the blackmailer by 
keeping  
a watch on him from your room, which commanded the line of  
communications.  But Jackson was clever enough to leave his  
victualing to the night-time.  I scattered the flour to try the  
result of that ancient trick.  It was successful.";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0
"That is all.  
Do  
you follow me?""  
  
""Yes,"" said I; ""but how did Jackson come to know the secret hiding
  
place?""  
  
""He has long been a servant of the house.  You had better ask his 
old  
master."" ";0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"I, James Phillips, stood with my back to the fire, smoking and  
puzzling over it.  It was worth all the headlines the newspapers 
had  
given it; there was no loophole to the mystery.  
  
Both sides of the Atlantic knew Silas J. Ford.  He had established
 a  
business reputation in America that had made him a celebrity in  
England from the day he stepped off the liner.  Once in London his
  
syndicates and companies and consolidations had startled the  
slow-moving British mind.  The commercial sky of the United 
Kingdom  
was overshadowed by him and his schemes.  The papers were full of
  
praise and blame, of puffs and denunciations.  He was a 
millionaire;  
he was on the verge of a smash that would paralyze the markets of 
the  
world.  He was an abstainer, a drunkard, a gambler, a most 
religious  
man.  He was a confirmed bachelor, a woman hater; his engagement 
was  
to be announced shortly.  So was the gossip kept rolling with the
  
limelight always centred upon the spot where Silas J. Ford 
happened  
to be standing.  
  
And now he had disappeared, vanished, evaporated.  
  
On the night of December 18, a Thursday, he had left London for  
Meudon Hall, the fine old Hampshire mansion that he had rented 
from  
Lord Beverley.  The two most trusted men in his office accompanied
  
him.  Friday morning he had spent with them; but at three o'clock 
the  
pair had returned to London, leaving their chief behind.  From 
four  
to seven he had been shut up with his secretary.  It was a hard 
time  
for every one, a time verging upon panic, and at such times Silas 
J.  
Ford was not an idle man.  
  
At eight o'clock he had dined.  His one recreation was music, and
  
after the meal he had played the organ in the picture gallery for 
an  
hour.  At a quarter past eleven he retired to his bedroom, 
dismissing  
Jackson, his body servant, for the night.  Three-quarters of an 
hour  
later, however, Harbord, his secretary, had been called to the  
private telephone, for Mr. Ford had brought an extension wire from
  
the neighboring town of Camdon.  It was a London message, and so  
urgent that he decided to wake his chief.  There was no answer to 
his  
knock, and on entering the room he found that Mr. Ford was not in
  
bed.  He was surprised, but in no way suspicious, and started to  
search the house.  He was joined by a footman, and, a little 
later,  
by Jackson and the butler.  Astonishment changed to alarm.  Other
  
servants were roused to aid in the quest.  Finally, a party, 
provided  
with lanterns from the stables, commenced to examine the grounds.
  
  
Snow had fallen early in the day, covering the great lawns in 
front  
of the entrance porch with a soft white blanket, about an inch in
  
thickness.  It was the head groom who struck the trail.  
Apparently  
Mr. Ford had walked out of the porch, and so over the drive and  
across the lawn toward the wall that bounded the public road.  
This  
road, which led from Meudon village to the town of Camdon, crossed
  
the front of Meudon Hall at a distance of some quarter of a mile.
  
  
There was no doubt as to the identity of the footprints, for Silas
  
Ford affected a broad, square-toed boot, easily recognizable from 
its  
unusual impression.  
  
They tracked him by their lanterns to the park wall, and there all
  
trace of him disappeared.  The wall was of rough stone, easily  
surmountable by an active man.  The snow that covered the road  
outside had been churned into muddy paste by the traffic of the 
day;  
there were no further footprints observable.  
  
The party returned to the house in great bewilderment.  The 
telephone  
to London brought no explanation, and the following morning Mr.  
Harbord caught the first train to town to make inquiries.  For  
private reasons his friends did not desire publicity for the 
affair,  
and it was not until the late afternoon, when all their  
investigations had proved fruitless, that they communicated with  
Scotland Yard.  When the papers went to press the whereabouts of 
the  
great Mr. Ford still remained a mystery.";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
"In keen curiosity I set off up the stairs to Inspector Peace's 
room.  
Perhaps the little detective had later news to give me.  
  
I found him standing with his back to the fire puffing at his  
cigarette with a plump solemnity.  A bag, neatly shaped, lay on 
the  
rug at his feet.  He nodded a welcome, watching me over his 
glasses.  
  
""I expected you, Mr. Phillips,"" he said.  ""And how do you explain 
it?""  
  
""A love affair or temporary insanity,"" I suggested vaguely.  
  
""Surely we can combine those solutions,"" he smiled.  ""Anything 
else?""  
  
""No.  I came to ask your opinion.""  
  
""My mind is void of theories, Mr. Phillips, and I shall endeavor 
to  
keep it so for the present.  If you wish to amuse yourself by  
discussing possibilities, I would suggest your consideration of 
the  
reason why, if he wanted to disappear quietly, he should leave so
  
obvious a track through the snow of his own lawn.  For myself, as 
I  
am leaving for Camdon via Waterloo Station in ten minutes, I shall
  
hope for more definite data before night.""  
  
""Peace,"" I asked him eagerly, ""may I come with you?""  
  
""If you can be ready in time,"" he said.  
  
It was past two o'clock when we arrived at the old town of Camdon.
  A  
carriage met us at the station.  Five minutes more and we were 
clear  
of the narrow streets and climbing the first bare ridge of the 
downs.  
It was a desolate prospect enough--a bare expanse of wind-swept 
land  
that rose and fell with the sweeping regularity of the Pacific 
swell.  
Here and there a clump of ragged firs showed black against the 
snow.  
Under that gentle carpet the crisp turf of the crests and the 
broad  
plow lands of the lower ground alike lay hidden.  I shivered, 
drawing  
my coat more closely about me.  
  
It was half an hour later that we topped a swelling rise and saw 
the  
gray towers of the ancient mansion beneath us.  In the shelter of 
the  
valley by the quiet river, that now lay frozen into silence, the  
trees had grown into splendid woodlands, circling the hall on the
  
further side.  From the broad front the white lawns crept down to 
the  
road on which we were driving.  Dark masses of shrubberies and the
  
tracery of scattered trees broke their silent curves.  The park 
wall  
that fenced them from the road stood out like an ink line ruled 
upon  
paper.  
  
""It must have been there that he disappeared,"" I cried, with a  
speculative finger.  
  
""So I imagine,"" said Peace.  ""And if he has spent two nights on 
the  
Hampshire downs, he will be looking for a fire to-day.  You have  
rather more than your fair share of the rug, Mr. Phillips, if you
  
will excuse my mentioning it.""  
  
A man was standing on the steps of the entrance porch when we 
drove  
up.  As we unrolled ourselves he stepped forward to help us.  He 
was  
a thin, pale-faced fellow, with fair hair and indeterminate eyes.
  
  
""My name is Harbord,"" he said.  ""You are Inspector Addington 
Peace, I  
believe.""  
  
His hand shook as he stretched it out in a tremulous greeting.  
Plainly the secretary was afraid, visibly and anxiously afraid.  
  
""Mr. Ransome, the manager of Mr. Ford's London office, is here,"" 
he  
continued.  ""He is waiting to see you in the library.""  
  
We followed him through a great hall into a room lined with books
  
from floor to ceiling.  A stout, dark man, who was pacing it like 
a  
beast in a cage, stopped at the sight of us.  His face, as he 
turned  
it toward us, looked pinched and gray in the full light.  
  
""Inspector Peace, eh?"" he said.  ""Well, Inspector, if you want a  
reward, name it.  If you want to pull the house down, only say the
  
word.  But find him for us, or, by heaven, we're done.""  
  
""Is it as bad as that?""  
  
""You can keep a secret, I suppose.  Yes--it couldn't well be 
worse.  
It was a tricky time; he hid half his schemes in his own head; he
  
never trusted even me altogether.  If he were dead I could plan  
something, but now--""  
  
He thumped his hand on the table and turned away to the window.  
  
""When you last saw Mr. Ford was he in good health?  Did he stand 
the  
strain?""  
  
""Ford had no nerves.  He was never better in his life.""  
  
""In these great transactions he would have his enemies.  If his 
plans  
succeeded there would be many hard hit, perhaps ruined.  Have you 
any  
suspicion of a man who, to save himself, might make away with Mr.
  
Ford?""  
  
""No,"" said the manager after a moment's thought.  ""No, I can not 
give  
you a single name.  The players are all big men, Inspector.  I 
don't  
say that their consciences would stop them from trying such a 
trick,  
but it wouldn't be worth their while.  They hold off when jail is 
the  
certain punishment.""  
  
""Was this financial crisis in his own affairs generally known?""  
  
""Certainly not.""  
  
""Who would know of it?""  
  
""There might be a dozen men on both sides of the Atlantic who 
would  
suspect the truth.  But I don't suppose that more than four people
  
were actually in possession of the facts.""  
  
""And who would they be?""  
  
""His two partners in America, myself, and Mr. Harbord there.""  
  
Peace turned to the young man with a smile and a polite bow.  
  
""Can you add any names to the list?"" he asked.  
  
""No,"" said Harbord, staring at the detective with a puzzled look, 
as  
if trying to catch the drift of his questions.  
  
""Thank you,"" said the Inspector; ""and now will you show me the 
place  
where this curious disappearance occurred?""  
  
We crossed the drive, where the snow lay torn and trampled by the
  
carriages, and so to the white, even surface of the lawn.  We soon
  
struck the trail, a confused path beaten by many footprints.  
Peace  
stooped for a moment, and then turned to the secretary with an 
angry  
glance.  
  
""Were you with them?"" he said.  
  
""Yes.""  
  
""Then why, in the name of common sense, didn't you keep them off 
his  
tracks?  You have simply trampled them out of existence, between 
you.""  
  
""We were in a hurry, Inspector,"" said the secretary meekly.  ""We  
didn't think about it.""  
  
We walked forward, following the broad trail until we came to a  
circular patch of trodden snow.  Evidently the searchers had 
stopped  
and stood talking together.  On the further side I saw the 
footprints  
of a man plainly defined.  There were some half-dozen clear  
impressions and they ended at the base of the old wall, which was
  
some six feet in height.  
  
""I am glad to see that you and your friends have left me 
something,  
Mr. Harbord,"" said the Inspector.  
  
He stepped forward and, kneeling down, examined the nearest 
footprint.  
  
""Mr. Ford dressed for dinner?"" he inquired, glancing up at the  
secretary.  
  
""Certainly!  Why do you ask?""  
  
""Merely that he had on heavy shooting boots when he took this 
evening  
stroll.  It will be interesting to discover what clothes he wore.""
  
  
The Inspector walked up to the wall, moving parallel to the tracks
 in  
the snow.  With singular activity for his plump and unathletic 
figure  
he climbed to the top and seated himself while he stared about 
him.  
Then on his hands and knees he began to crawl forward along the  
coping.  It was a quaint spectacle, but the extraordinary care and
  
vigilance of the little man took the farce out of it.  
  
Presently he stopped and looked down at us with a gentle smile.  
  
""Please stay where you are,"" he said, and disappeared on the 
further  
side.  
  
Harbord offered me a cigarette, and we waited with due obedience 
till  
the Inspector's bullet-head again broke the horizon as he 
struggled  
back to his position on the coping of the wall.  
  
He seemed in a very pleasant temper when he joined us; but he said
  
nothing of his discoveries, and I had grown too wise to inquire.  
When we reached the entrance hall he asked for Jackson, the valet,
  
and in a couple of minutes the man appeared.  He was a tall,  
hatchet-faced fellow, very neatly dressed in black.  He made a 
little  
bow, and then stood watching us in a most respectful attitude.  
  
""A queer business this, Jackson,"" said Addington Peace.  
  
""Yes, sir.""  
  
""And what is your opinion on it?""  
  
""To be frank, sir, I thought at first that Mr. Ford had run away; 
but  
now I don't know what to make of it.""  
  
""And why should he run away?""  
  
""I have no idea, sir; but he seemed to me rather strange in his  
manner yesterday.""  
  
""Have you been with him long?""  
  
""No, sir.  I was valet to the Honorable John Dorn, Lord Beverley's
  
second son.  Mr. Ford took me from Mr. Dorn at the time he rented 
the  
Hall.""  
  
""I see.  And now will you show me your master's room?  I shall see
  
you again later, Mr. Harbord,"" he continued; ""in the meanwhile I 
will  
leave my assistant with you.""  
  
We sat and smoked in the secretary's room.  He was not much of a  
talker, consuming cigarette after cigarette in silence.  The 
winter  
dusk had already fallen when the Inspector joined us, and we 
retired  
to our rooms to prepare for dinner.  I tried a word with Peace 
upon  
the staircase, but he shook his head and walked on.  
  
The meal dragged itself to an end somehow, and we left Ransome 
with a  
second decanter of port before him.  Peace slipped away again, and
 I  
consoled myself with a book in the library until half-past ten, 
when  
I walked off to bed.  A servant was switching off the light in the
  
hall when I mounted the great staircase.  
  
My room was in the old wing at the further side of the picture  
gallery, and I had some difficulty in steering my way through the
  
dark corridors.  The mystery that hung over the house had shaken 
my  
nerves, and I remember that I started at every creak of a board 
and  
peered into the shadows as I passed along with, Heaven knows, what
  
ghostly expectations.  I was glad enough to close my door upon 
them  
and see the wood fire blazing cheerfully in the open hearth.  
  
. . . . . . . . . . . .  
  
I woke with a start that left me sitting up in bed, with my heart
  
thumping in my ribs like a piston rod.  I am not generally a light
  
sleeper, but that night, even while I snored, my nerves were 
active.  
Some one had tapped at my door--that was my impression.  
  
I listened with the uncertain fear that comes to the newly waked.
  
Then I heard it again--on the wall near my head this time.  A 
board  
creaked.  Some one was groping his way down the dark corridor  
without.  Presently he stopped, and a faint line of illumination  
sprang out under my door.  It winked, and then grew still.  He had
  
lighted a candle.  
  
Assurance came with the streak of light.  What was he doing, 
groping  
in the dark, if he had a candle with him?  I crept over to the 
door,  
opened it, and stared cautiously out.  
  
About a dozen feet away a man was standing, a striking figure 
against  
the light he carried.  His back was toward me, but I could see 
that  
his hand was shading the candle from his eyes while he stared into
  
the shadows that clung about the further end of the corridor.  
  
Presently he began to move forward.  
  
The picture gallery and the body of the house lay behind.  The  
corridor in which he stood terminated in a window, set deep into 
the  
stone of the old walls.  The man walked slowly, throwing the light
 to  
right and left.  His attitude was of nervous expectation--that of 
a  
man who looked for something that he feared to see.  
  
At the window he stopped, staring about him and listening.  He  
examined the fastenings, and then tried a door on his right.  It 
was  
locked against him.  As he did so I caught his profile against the
  
light.  It was Harbord, the secretary.  From where I stood he was 
not  
more than forty feet away.  There was no possibility of a mistake.
  
  
As he turned to come back I retreated into my room, closing the 
door.  
The fellow was in a state of great agitation, and I could hear him
  
muttering to himself as he walked.  When he had passed by I peeped
  
out to see him and his light dwindle, reach the corner by the 
picture  
gallery, and fade into a reflection, a darkness.  
  
I took care to turn the key before I got back into bed.  
  
I woke again at seven, and, hurrying on my clothes, set off to 
tell  
Peace all about it.  I took him to the place, and together we  
examined the corridor.  There were only two rooms beyond mine.  
The  
one on the left was occupied by Ransome; that on the right was a  
large store-room, the door of which was locked.  The housekeeper 
kept  
the key, we learned upon inquiry.  Whom had Harbord followed?  The
  
problem was beyond me.  As for Inspector Peace, he did not indulge
 in  
verbal speculations.  
  
It was in the central hall that we encountered the secretary on 
his  
way to the breakfast-room.  The man looked nervous and depressed; 
he  
nodded to us and was passing on, when Peace stopped him.  
  
""Good-morning, Mr. Harbord,"" he said.  ""Can I have a word with 
you?""  
  
""Certainly, Inspector.  What is it?""  
  
""I have a favor to ask.  My assistant and myself have our hands 
full  
here.  If necessary, could you help us by running up to London 
and--""  
  
""For the day?"" he interrupted.  
  
""No.  It may be an affair of three or four days.""  
  
""Then I must refuse.  I am sorry, but--""  
  
""Don't apologize, Mr. Harbord,"" said the little man, cheerfully.  
""I  
shall have to find some one else, that is all.""  
  
We walked into the breakfast-room, and a few minutes later Ransome
  
appeared with a great bundle of letters and telegrams in his hand.
  
He said not a word to any of us, but dropped into a chair, tearing
  
open the envelopes and glancing at their contents.  His face grew
  
darker as he read, and once he thumped his hand upon the table 
with a  
crash that set the china jingling.  
  
""Well, Inspector?"" he said at last.  
  
The little detective's head shook out a negative.  
  
""Perhaps you require an incentive,"" he sneered.  ""Is it a matter 
of a  
reward?""  
  
""No, Mr. Ransome; but it is becoming one of my personal 
reputation.""  
  
""Then, by thunder, you are in danger of losing it.  Why don't you 
and  
your friend hustle instead of loitering around as if you were paid
 by  
the job?  I tell you, man, there are thousands, hundreds of 
thousands  
melting, slipping through our fingers, every hour of the day.""  
  
He sprang from his seat and started his walk again, up and down, 
up  
and down, as we had first seen him.  
  
""Shall you be returning to London?""  
  
At the question the manager halted in his stride, staring sharply
  
down into the Inspector's bland countenance.  
  
""No,"" he said; ""I shall stay here, Mr. Addington Peace, until such
  
time as you have something definite to tell me.""  
  
""I have an inquiry to make which I would rather place in the hands
 of  
some one who has personal knowledge of Mr. Ford.  Neither Mr. 
Harbord  
nor yourself desire to leave Meudon.  Is there any one else you 
can  
suggest?""  
  
""There is Jackson, Ford's valet,"" said the manager, after a 
moment's  
thought.  ""He can go if you think him bright enough.  I'll send 
for  
him.""  
  
While the footman who answered the bell was gone upon his errand 
we  
waited in an uneasy silence.  There was the shadow of an ugly 
mystery  
upon us all.  Jackson, as he entered, was the only one who seemed 
at  
his ease.  He stood there, a tall figure of all the 
respectabilities.  
  
""The Inspector here wishes you to go to London, Jackson,"" said the
  
manager.  ""He will explain the details.  There is a fast train 
from  
Camdon at eleven.""  
  
""Certainly, sir.  Do I return to-night?""  
  
""No, Jackson,"" said Peace.  ""It will take a day or two.""  
  
The man took a couple of steps toward the door, hesitated, and 
then  
returned to his former place.  
  
""I beg your pardon, sir,"" he began, addressing Ransome.  ""But I 
would  
rather remain at Meudon under present circumstances.""  
  
""What on earth do you mean?"" thundered the manager.  
  
""Well, sir, I was the last to see Mr. Ford.  There is, as it were,
 a  
suspicion upon me.  I should like to be present while the search  
continues, both for his sake--and my own.""  
  
""Very kind of you, I'm sure,"" growled Ransome.  ""But you either do
  
what I tell you, Jackson, or you pack your boxes and clear out.  
So  
be quick and make up your mind.""  
  
""I think you are treating me most unfairly, sir.  But I can not be
  
persuaded out of what I know to be my duty.""  
  
""You impertinent rascal!--"" began the furious manager.  But Peace 
was  
already on his feet with a chubby hand outstretched.  
  
""Perhaps, after all, I can make other arrangements, Mr. Ransome,"" 
he  
said.  ""It is natural that Jackson should consider his own 
reputation  
in this affair.  That is all, Jackson; you may go now.""  
  
It was half an hour afterward, when the end of breakfast had  
dispersed the party, that I spoke to Peace about it, offering to 
go  
to London myself and do my best to carry out his instructions.  
  
""I had bad luck in my call for volunteers,"" he said.  
  
""I should have thought they would have been glad enough to get the
  
chance of work.  They can find no particular amusement in loafing
  
about the place all day.""  
  
""Doubtless they all had excellent reasons,"" he said with a smile.
  
""But, anyway, you can not be spared, Mr. Phillips.""  
  
""You flatter me.""  
  
""I want you to stay in your bedroom.  Write, read, do what you 
like,  
but keep your door ajar.  If any one passes down the corridor, see
  
where he goes, only don't let him know that you are watching him 
if  
you can help it.  I will take my turn at half-past one.  I don't 
mean  
to starve you.""  
  
I obeyed.  After all, it was, in a manner, promotion that the  
Inspector had given me; yet it was a tedious, anxious time.  No 
one  
came my way, barring a sour-looking housemaid.  I tried to argue 
out  
the case, but the deeper I got the more conflicting grew my 
theories.  
I was never more glad to see a friendly face than when the little 
man  
came in upon me.  
  
The short winter's afternoon crept on, the Inspector and I taking
  
turn and turn about in our sentry duty.  Dinner-time came and 
went.  
I had been off duty from nine, but at ten-thirty I poured out a  
whisky and soda and went back to join him.  He was sitting in the
  
middle of the room smoking a pipe in great apparent satisfaction.
  
  
""Bed-time, isn't it?"" I grumbled, sniffing at his strong tobacco.
  
  
""Oh, no,"" he said.  ""The fact is, we are going to sit up all 
night.""  
  
I threw myself on a couch by the window without reply.  Perhaps I 
was  
not in the best of tempers; certainly I did not feel so.  
  
""You insisted on coming down with me,"" he suggested.  
  
""I know all about that,"" I told him.  ""I haven't complained, have 
I?  
If you want me to shut myself up for a week I'll do it; but I 
should  
prefer to have some idea of the reason why.""  
  
""I don't wish to create mysteries, Mr. Phillips,"" he said kindly;
  
""but believe me there is nothing to be gained in vague 
discussions.""  
  
I knew that settled it as far as he was concerned, so I nodded my
  
head and filled a pipe.  At eleven he walked across the room and  
switched off the light.  
  
""If nothing happens you can take your turn in four hours from 
now,""  
he said.  ""In the meanwhile get to sleep.  I will keep the first  
watch.""  
  
I shut my eyes, but there was no rest in me that night.  I lay  
listening to the silence of the old house with a dull speculation.
  
Somewhere far down in the lower floor a great gong-like clock 
chimed  
the hours and quarters.  I heard them every one, from twelve to 
one,  
from one to two.  Peace had stopped smoking.  He sat as silent as 
a  
cat at a mousehole.  
  
It must have been some fifteen minutes after two that I heard the
  
faint, faint creak of a board in the corridor outside.  I sat up,
  
every nerve strung to a tense alertness.  And then there came a 
sound  
I knew well, the soft drawing touch of a hand groping in the 
darkness  
as some one felt his way along the paneled walls.  It passed us 
and  
was gone.  Yet Peace never moved.  Could he have fallen asleep?  I
  
whispered his name.  
  
""Hush!""  
  
The answer came to me like a gentle sigh.  
  
One minute, two minutes more and the room sprang into sight under 
the  
steady glow of an electric hand-lamp.  The Inspector rose from his
  
seat and slid through the door with me upon his heels.  The light 
he  
carried searched the clustered shadows; but the corridor was 
empty,  
nor was there any place where a man might hide.  
  
""You waited too long,"" I whispered impatiently.  
  
""The man is no fool, Mr. Phillips.  Do you imagine that he was not
  
listening and staring like a hunted beast?  A noisy board, a 
stumble,  
or a flash of light, and we should have wasted a tiring day.""  
  
""Nevertheless he has got clear away.""  
  
""I think not.""  
  
As we crept forward I saw that a strip of the oak flooring along 
the  
walls was gray with dust.  If it had been in such a neglected 
state  
in the afternoon I should surely have noticed it.  In some 
curiosity  
I stooped to examine the phenomenon.  
  
""Flour,"" whispered the little man touching my shoulder.  
  
""Flour?""  
  
""Yes.  I sprinkled it myself.  Look--there is the first result.""  
  
He steadied his light as he spoke, pointing with his other hand.  
On  
the powdery surface was the half footprint of a man.  
  
The flour did not extend more than a couple of feet from the 
walls,  
so that it was only here and there that we caught up the trail.  
We  
had passed the bedroom on the left--yet the footprints still went 
on;  
we were at the store-room door, yet they still were visible before
  
us.  There was no other egress from the corridor.  The tall window
 at  
the end was, as I knew, a good twenty feet from the ground.  Had 
this  
man also vanished off the earth like Silas Ford?  
  
Suddenly the inspector stopped, grasping my arm.  The light he 
held  
fell upon two footprints close together.  They were at right 
angles  
to the passage.  Apparently the man had passed into the solid 
wall!  
  
""Peace, what does this mean?""  
  
You, sir, sitting peaceably at home, with a good light and an easy
  
conscience, may think I was a timid fool; yet I was 
afraid--honestly  
and openly afraid.  The little detective heard the news of it in 
my  
voice, for he gave me a reassuring pat upon the back.  
  
""Have you never heard of a 'priest's hole'?"" he whispered.  ""In 
the  
days when Meudon Hall was built, no country house was without its
  
hiding-place.  Protestants and priests, Royalists and Republicans,
  
they all used the secret burrow at one time or another.""  
  
""How did he get in?""  
  
""That is what we are here to discover, and as I have no wish to  
destroy Mr. Ford's old oak panels I think our simplest plan will 
be  
to wait until he comes back again.""  
  
The shadows leaped upon us as Peace extinguished the light he  
carried.  The great window alone was luminous with the faint  
starlight that showed the tracery of its ancient stonework; for 
the  
rest, the darkness hedged us about in impenetrable barriers.  Side
 by  
side, we stood by the wall in which we knew the secret entrance 
must  
exist.  
  
It may have been ten minutes or more when from the  
distance--somewhere below our feet, or so it seemed to me--there 
came  
the faint echo of a closing door.  It was only in such cold 
silence  
that we could have heard it.  The time ticked on.  Suddenly, upon 
the  
black of the floor, there shone a thin reflection like the slash 
of a  
sword--a reflection that grew into a broad gush of light as the  
sliding panel in the wall, six feet from where we stood, rose to 
the  
full opening.  There followed another pause, during which I could 
see  
Peace draw himself together as if for some unusual exertion.  
  
A shadow darkened the reflection on the floor, and a head came  
peering out.  The light but half displayed the face, but I could 
see  
that the teeth were bare and glistening, like those of a man in 
some  
deadly expectation.  The next moment he stepped across the 
threshold.  
With a spring like the rush of a terrier, Addington Peace was upon
  
him, driving him off his balance with the impact of the blow.  
Before  
I could reach them, the little detective had him down, though he  
still kicked viciously until I lent a hand.  The click of the  
handcuffs on his wrist ended the matter.  
  
It was Ford's valet, the man Jackson.  
  
We were not long by ourselves.  I heard a key turned in the lock, 
and  
Ransome burst out of his room into the corridor like an angry 
bull.  
Almost at the same moment there sounded a quick patter of naked 
feet  
from behind us, and Harbord, the secretary, came running up, 
swinging  
a heavy stick in his hand.  They both stopped at the edge of the  
patch of light in which we were, staring from us to the gaping 
hole  
in the wall.  
  
""What in thunder are you about?"" cried the manager.  
  
""Finding a solution to your problem,"" said the little detective,  
getting to his feet.  ""Perhaps, gentlemen, you will be good enough
 to  
follow me.""  
  
He stepped through the opening in the wall, and lifted the candle
  
which the valet had placed on the floor while he was raising the  
panel from within.  By its light I could see the first steps of a
  
flight which led down into darkness.  
  
""We will take Jackson with us,"" he continued.  ""Keep an eye on 
him,  
Mr. Phillips, if you please.""";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
"It was a strange procession that we made.  First Peace, with the  
candle, then Ransome, with the valet, following, while I and 
Harbord  
brought up the rear.  We descended some thirty steps, formed in 
the  
thickness of the wall, opened a heavy door, and so found ourselves
 in  
a narrow chamber, some twelve feet long by seven broad.  Upon a  
mattress at the further end lay a man, gagged and bound.  As the  
light fell upon his features, Ransome sprang forward, shouting his
  
name.  
  
""Silas Ford, by thunder!""  
  
With eager fingers we loosened the gag and cut the ropes that 
bound  
his wrists.  He sat up, turning his long, thin face from one to 
the  
other of us as he stretched the cramp from his limbs.  
  
""Thank you, gentlemen,"" said he.  ""Well, Ransome, how are things?""
  
  
""Bad, sir; but it's not too late.""  
  
He nodded his head, passing his hands through his hair with a 
quick,  
nervous movement.  
  
""You've caught my clever friend, I see.  Kindly go through his  
pockets, will you?  He has something I must ask him to return to 
me.""  
  
We found it in Jackson's pocket-book--a check, antedated a week, 
for  
five thousand pounds, with a covering letter to the manager of the
  
bank.  Ford took the bit of stamped paper, twisting it to and fro 
in  
his supple fingers.  
  
""It was smart of you, Jackson,"" he said, addressing the bowed 
figure  
before him: ""I give you credit for the idea.  To kidnap a man just
 as  
he was bringing off a big deal--well, you would have earned the  
money.""  
  
""But how did you get down here?"" struck in the manager.  
  
""He told me that he had discovered an old hiding-place--a 
'priest's  
hole,' he called it--and I walked into the trap as the best man 
may  
do sometimes.  As we got to the bottom of that stairway he slipped
 a  
sack over my head and had me fixed in thirty seconds.  He fed me  
himself twice a day, standing by to see I didn't halloo.  When I 
paid  
up he was to have twenty-four hours' start; then he would let you
  
know where I was.  I held out awhile, but I gave in to-night.  The
  
delay was getting too dangerous.  Have you a cigarette, Harbord?  
Thank you.  And who may you be?""  
  
It was to the detective he spoke.  
  
""My name is Peace, Inspector Addington Peace, from Scotland Yard.""
  
  
""And I owe my rescue to you?""  
  
The little man bowed.  
  
""You will have no reason to regret it.  And what did they think 
had  
become of me, Inspector?""  
  
""It was the general opinion that you had taken to yourself wings, 
Mr.  
Ford."" ";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
"It was as we traveled up to town next day that Peace told me his  
story.  I will set it down as briefly as may be.  
  
""I soon came to the conclusion that Ford, whether dead or alive, 
was  
inside the grounds of Meudon Hall.  If he had bolted, for some  
reason, by the way, which was perfectly incomprehensible, a man of
  
his ability would not have left a broad trail across the centre of
  
his lawn for all to see.  There was, moreover, no trace of him 
that  
our men could ferret out at any station within reasonable 
distance.  
A motor was possible, but there were no marks of its presence next
  
morning in the mud of the roads.  That fact I learned from a 
curious  
groom who had aided in the search, and who, with a similar idea 
upon  
him, had carefully examined the highway at daybreak.  
  
""When I clambered to the top of the wall I found that the snow 
upon  
the coping had been dislodged.  I traced the marks, as you saw, 
for  
about a dozen yards.  Where they ended I, too, dropped to the 
ground  
outside.  There I made a remarkable discovery.  Upon a little 
drift  
of snow that lay in the shallow ditch beneath were more 
footprints.  
But they were not those of Ford.  They were the marks of long and
  
narrow boots, which led into the road, where they were lost in the
  
track of a flock of sheep that had been driven over it the day 
before.  
  
""I took a careful measurement of those footprints.  They might, of
  
course, belong to some private investigator; but they gave me an  
idea.  Could some man have walked across the lawn in Ford's boots,
  
changed them to his own on the top of the wall, and so departed?  
Was  
it the desire of someone to let it be supposed that Ford had run 
away?  
  
""When I examined Ford's private rooms I was even more fortunate.  
From the boot-boy I discovered that the master had three pairs of
  
shooting boots.  There were three pairs in the stand.  Some one 
had  
made a very serious mistake.  Instead of hiding the pair he had 
used  
on the lawn, he had returned them to their place.  The trick was  
becoming evident.  But where was Ford?  In the house or grounds, 
dead  
or alive, but where?  
  
""I was able, through my friend the boot-boy, to examine the boots 
on  
the night of our arrival.  My measurements corresponded with those
  
that Jackson, the valet, wore.  Was he acting for himself, or was
  
Harbord, or even Ransome, in the secret?  That, too, it was 
necessary  
to discover before I showed my hand.  
  
""Your story of Harbord's midnight excursion supplied a clue.  The
  
secretary had evidently followed some man who had disappeared  
mysteriously.  Could there be the entrance to a secret chamber in
  
that corridor?  That would explain the mystification of Harbord as
  
well as the disappearance of Silas Ford.  If so, Harbord was not  
involved.  
  
""If Ford were held a prisoner he must be fed.  His jailer must of
  
necessity remain in the house.  But the trap I set in the 
suggested  
journey to town was an experiment singularly unsuccessful, for all
  
the three men I desired to test refused.  However, if I were right
  
about the secret chamber I could checkmate the blackmailer by 
keeping  
a watch on him from your room, which commanded the line of  
communications.  But Jackson was clever enough to leave his  
victualing to the night-time.  I scattered the flour to try the  
result of that ancient trick.  It was successful.  That is all.  
Do  
you follow me?""  
  
""Yes,"" said I; ""but how did Jackson come to know the secret hiding
  
place?""  
  
""He has long been a servant of the house.  You had better ask his 
old  
master.""";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0
