    "master. They were Italians, and the elder of the two, a man of about \n",
    "forty, gave his name as Signor Ascanio. \n",
    "The younger was a well-dressed lad of about twenty-four. \n",
    "Count Foscatini was evidently prepared for their visit and \n",
    "immediately sent Graves out upon some trivial errand. \n",
    "Here the man paused and hesitated in his story. \n",
    "In the end, however, he admitted that, curious as to the purport \n",
    "of the interview, he had not obeyed immediately, but had lingered \n",
    "about endeavouring to hear something of what was going on. \n",
    "The conversation was carried on in so low a tone that he was not \n",
    "as successful as he had hoped; but he gathered enough to make it \n",
    "clear that some kind of monetary proposition was being discussed, \n",
    "and that the basis of it was a threat. \n",
    "The discussion was anything but amicable. \n",
    "In the end, Count Foscatini raised his voice slightly, and the \n",
    "listener heard these words clearly:  'I have no time to argue \n",
    "further now, gentlemen. \n",
    "If you will dine with me to-morrow night at eight o’clock, we will\n",
    " resume the discussion.'  Afraid of being discovered listening, \n",
    "Graves had then hurried out to do his master’s errand. \n",
    "This evening the two men had arrived punctually at eight. \n",
    "During dinner they had talked of indifferent matters—politics, the\n",
    " weather, and the theatrical world. \n",
    "When Graves had placed the port upon the table and brought in the \n",
    "coffee his master told him that he might have the evening off. \n",
    "'Was that a usual proceeding of his when he had guests?' asked the\n",
    " inspector. \n",
    "'No, sir; it wasn’t. \n",
    "That’s what made me think it must be some business of a very \n",
    "unusual kind that he was going to discuss with these gentlemen.'  \n",
    "That finished Graves’s story. \n",
    "He had gone out about 8.30, and, meeting a friend, had accompanied\n",
    " him to the Metropolitan Music Hall in Edgware Road. \n",
    "Nobody had seen the two men leave, but the time of the murder was \n",
    "fixed clearly enough at 8.47. \n",
    "A small clock on the writing-table had been swept off by \n",
    "Foscatini’s arm, and had stopped at that hour, which agreed with \n",
    "Miss Rider’s telephone summons. \n",
    "The police surgeon had made his examination of the body, and it \n",
    "was now lying on the couch. \n",
    "I saw the face for the first time—the olive complexion, the long \n",
    "nose, the luxuriant black moustache, and the full red lips drawn \n",
    "back from the dazzlingly white teeth. \n",
    "Not altogether a pleasant face. \n",
    "'Well,' said the inspector, refastening his notebook. \n",
    "'The case seems clear enough. \n",

    "I suppose his address is not in the dead man’s pocket-book by any \n",

    "man. \n",
    "Neatly written in small, precise handwriting was the inscription, \n",
    "'Signor Paolo Ascanio, Grosvenor Hotel.'  The inspector busied \n",
    "himself with the telephone, then turned to us with a grin. \n",
    "'Just in time. \n",

    "Continong. \n",
    "Well, gentlemen, that’s about all we can do here. \n",

    "airily dismissed, we found our way downstairs. \n",
    "Dr. Hawker was full of excitement. \n",
    "'Like the beginning of a novel, eh? \n",
    "Real exciting stuff. \n",
    "Wouldn’t believe it if you read about it.'  Poirot did not speak. \n",
    "He was very thoughtful. \n",
    "All the evening he had hardly opened his lips. \n",
    "'What says the master detective, eh?' asked Hawker, clapping him \n",
    "on the back. \n",
    "'Nothing to work your grey cells over this time.'  'You think \n",
    "not?'  'What could there be?'  'Well, for example, there is the \n",
    "window.'  'The window? \n",
    "But it was fastened. \n",
    "Nobody could have got out or in that way. \n",
    "I noticed it specially.'  'And why were you able to notice it?'  \n",
    "The doctor looked puzzled. \n",
    "Poirot hastened to explain. \n",
    "'It is to the curtains I refer. \n",
    "They were not drawn. \n",
    "A little odd, that. \n",
    "And then there was the coffee. \n",
    "It was very black coffee.'  'Well, what of it?'  'Very black,' \n",
    "repeated Poirot. \n",
    "'In conjunction with that let us remember that very little of the \n",
    "rice soufflé was eaten, and we get—what?'  'Moonshine,' laughed \n",
    "the doctor. \n",
    "'You’re pulling my leg.'  'Never do I pull the leg. \n",
    "Hastings here knows that I am perfectly serious.'  'I don’t know \n",
    "what you are getting at, all the same,' I confessed. \n",
    "'You don’t suspect the manservant, do you? \n",
    "He might have been in with the gang, and put some dope in the \n",
    "coffee. \n",
    "I suppose they’ll test his alibi?'  'Without doubt, my friend; but\n",
    " it is the alibi of Signor Ascanio that interests me.'  'You think\n",
    " he has an alibi?'  'That is just what worries me. \n",
    "I have no doubt that we will soon be enlightened on that point.'\n",
    " The _Daily Newsmonger_ enabled us to become conversant with \n",
    "succeeding events. \n",
    "Signor Ascanio was arrested and charged with the murder of Count \n",
    "Foscatini. \n",
    "When arrested, he denied knowing the Count, and declared he had \n",
    "never been near Regent’s Court either on the evening of the crime \n",
    "or on the previous morning. \n",
    "The younger man had disappeared entirely. \n",
    "Signor Ascanio had arrived alone at the Grosvenor Hotel from the \n",
    "Continent two days before the murder. \n",
    "All efforts to trace the second man failed. \n",
    "Ascanio, however, was not sent for trial. \n",
    "No less a personage than the Italian Ambassador himself came \n",
    "forward and testified at the police-court proceedings that Ascanio\n",
    " had been with him at the Embassy from eight till nine that \n",
    "evening. \n",
    "The prisoner was discharged. \n",
    "Naturally, a lot of people thought that the crime was a political \n",
    "one, and was being deliberately hushed up. \n",
    "Poirot had taken a keen interest in all these points. \n",
    "Nevertheless, I was somewhat surprised when he suddenly informed \n",
    "me one morning that he was expecting a visitor at eleven o’clock, \n",
    "and that that visitor was none other than Ascanio himself. \n",
    "'He wishes to consult you?'  '_Du tout_, Hastings. \n",
    "I wish to consult him.'  'What about?'  'The Regent’s Court \n",
    "murder.'  'You are going to prove that he did it?'  'A man cannot \n",
    "be tried twice for murder, Hastings. \n",
    "Endeavour to have the common sense. \n",
    "Ah, that is our friend’s ring. A few minutes later Signor \n",
    "Ascanio was ushered in—a small, thin man with a secretive and \n",
    "furtive glance in his eyes. \n",
    "He remained standing, darting suspicious glances from one to the \n",
    "other of us. \n",
    "'Monsieur Poirot?'  My little friend tapped himself gently on the \n",
    "chest. \n",
    "'Be seated, signor. \n",
    "You received my note. \n",

    "gesture. \n",
    "'I did nothing of the sort. \n",
    "I have sworn in court——'  '_Précisément_—and I have a little idea \n",
    "that you have sworn falsely.'  'You threaten me? \n",
    "Bah! \n",
    "I have nothing to fear from you. \n",
    "I have been acquitted.'  'Exactly; and as I am not an imbecile, it\n",

    "Publicity! \n",
    "I see that you do not like the word. \n",
    "I had an idea that you would not. \n",
    "My little ideas, you know, they are very valuable to me. \n",
