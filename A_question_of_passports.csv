"Bibot was very sure of himself. There never was, never had been, 
there 
never would be again another such patriotic citizen of the 
Republic as 
was citizen Bibot of the Town Guard. 
 
And because his patriotism was so well known among the members of 
the 
Committee of Public Safety, and his uncompromising hatred of the 
aristocrats so highly appreciated, citizen Bibot had been given 
the most 
important military post within the city of Paris. 
 
He was in command of the Porte Montmartre, which goes to prove how
 
highly he was esteemed, for, believe me, more treachery had been 
going 
on inside and out of the Porte Montmartre than in any other 
quarter of 
Paris. The last commandant there, citizen Ferney, was guillotined 
for 
having allowed a whole batch of aristocrats--traitors to the 
Republic, 
all of them--to slip through the Porte Montmartre and to find 
safety 
outside the walls of Paris. Ferney pleaded in his defence that 
these 
traitors had been spirited away from under his very nose by the 
devil's 
agency, for surely that meddlesome Englishman who spent his time 
in 
rescuing aristocrats--traitors, all of them--from the clutches of 
Madame 
la Guillotine must be either the devil himself, or at any rate one
 of 
his most powerful agents. 
 
""Nom de Dieu! just think of his name! The Scarlet Pimpernel they 
call 
him! No one knows him by any other name! and he is preternaturally
 tall 
and strong and superhumanly cunning! And the power which he has of
 being 
transmuted into various personalities--rendering himself quite 
unrecognisable to the eyes of the most sharp-seeing patriot of 
France, 
must of a surety be a gift of Satan!"" 
 
But the Committee of Public Safety refused to listen to Ferney's 
explanations. The Scarlet Pimpernel was only an ordinary 
mortal--an 
exceedingly cunning and meddlesome personage it is true, and 
endowed 
with a superfluity of wealth which enabled him to break the thin 
crust 
of patriotism that overlay the natural cupidity of many Captains 
of the 
Town Guard--but still an ordinary man for all that! and no true 
lover of 
the Republic should allow either superstitious terror or greed to 
interfere with the discharge of his duties which at the Porte 
Montmartre 
consisted in detaining any and every person--aristocrat, 
foreigner, or 
otherwise traitor to the Republic--who could not give a 
satisfactory 
reason for desiring to leave Paris. Having detained such persons, 
the 
patriot's next duty was to hand them over to the Committee of 
Public 
Safety, who would then decide whether Madame la Guillotine would 
have 
the last word over them or not. 
 
And the guillotine did nearly always have the last word to say, 
unless 
the Scarlet Pimpernel interfered. 
 
The trouble was, that that same accursed Englishman interfered at 
times 
in a manner which was positively terrifying. His impudence, 
certes, 
passed all belief. Stories of his daring and of his impudence were
 
abroad which literally made the lank and greasy hair of every 
patriot 
curl with wonder. 'Twas even whispered--not too loudly, 
forsooth--that 
certain members of the Committee of Public Safety had measured 
their 
skill and valour against that of the Englishman and emerged from 
the 
conflict beaten and humiliated, vowing vengeance which, of a 
truth, was 
still slow in coming. 
 
Citizen Chauvelin, one of the most implacable and unyielding 
members of 
the Committee, was known to have suffered overwhelming shame at 
the 
hands of that daring gang, of whom the so-called Scarlet Pimpernel
 was 
the accredited chief. Some there were who said that citizen 
Chauvelin 
had for ever forfeited his prestige, and even endangered his head 
by 
measuring his well-known astuteness against that mysterious League
 of 
spies. 
 
But then Bibot was different! 
 
He feared neither the devil, nor any Englishman. Had the latter 
the 
strength of giants and the protection of every power of evil, 
Bibot was 
ready for him. Nay! he was aching for a tussle, and haunted the 
purlieus 
of the Committees to obtain some post which would enable him to 
come to 
grips with the Scarlet Pimpernel and his League. 
 
Bibot's zeal and perseverance were duly rewarded, and anon he was 
appointed to the command of the guard at the Porte Montmartre. 
 
A post of vast importance as aforesaid; so much so, in fact, that 
no 
less a person than citizen Jean Paul Marat himself came to speak 
with 
Bibot on that third day of Nivose in the year I of the Republic, 
with a 
view to impressing upon him the necessity of keeping his eyes 
open, and 
of suspecting every man, woman, and child indiscriminately until 
they 
had proved themselves to be true patriots. ";0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0
"""Let no one slip through your fingers, citizen Bibot,"" Marat 
admonished 
with grim earnestness. ""That accursed Englishman is cunning and 
resourceful, and his impudence surpasses that of the devil 
himself."" 
 
""He'd better try some of his impudence on me!"" commented Bibot 
with a 
sneer, ""he'll soon find out that he no longer has a Ferney to deal
 with. 
Take it from me, citizen Marat, that if a batch of aristocrats 
escape 
out of Paris within the next few days, under the guidance of the 
d--d 
Englishman, they will have to find some other way than the Porte 
Montmartre."" 
 
""Well said, citizen!"" commented Marat. ""But be watchful to-night 
... 
to-night especially. The Scarlet Pimpernel is rampant in Paris 
just 
now."" 
 
""How so?"" 
 
""The ci-devant Duc and Duchesse de Montreux and the whole of their
 
brood--sisters, brothers, two or three children, a priest, and 
several 
servants--a round dozen in all, have been condemned to death. The 
guillotine for them to-morrow at daybreak! Would it could have 
been 
to-night,"" added Marat, whilst a demoniacal leer contorted his 
face 
which already exuded lust for blood from every pore. ""Would it 
could 
have been to-night. But the guillotine has been busy; over four 
hundred 
executions to-day ... and the tumbrils are full--the seats 
bespoken in 
advance--and still they come.... But to-morrow morning at daybreak
 
Madame la Guillotine will have a word to say to the whole of the 
Montreux crowd!"" 
 
""But they are in the Conciergerie prison surely, citizen! out of 
the 
reach of that accursed Englishman?"" 
 
""They are on their way, an I mistake not, to the prison at this 
moment. 
I came straight on here after the condemnation, to which I 
listened with 
true joy. Ah, citizen Bibot! the blood of these hated aristocrats 
is 
good to behold when it drips from the blade of the guillotine. 
Have a 
care, citizen Bibot, do not let the Montreux crowd escape!"" 
 
""Have no fear, citizen Marat! But surely there is no danger! They 
have 
been tried and condemned! They are, as you say, even now on their 
way--well guarded, I presume--to the Conciergerie 
prison!--to-morrow at 
daybreak, the guillotine! What is there to fear?"" 
 
""Well! well!"" said Marat, with a slight tone of hesitation, ""it is
 best, 
citizen Bibot, to be over-careful these times."" 
 
Even whilst Marat spoke his face, usually so cunning and so 
vengeful, 
had suddenly lost its look of devilish cruelty which was almost 
superhuman in the excess of its infamy, and a greyish 
hue--suggestive of 
terror--had spread over the sunken cheeks. He clutched Bibot's 
arm, and 
leaning over the table he whispered in his ear: 
 
""The Public Prosecutor had scarce finished his speech to-day, 
judgment 
was being pronounced, the spectators were expectant and still, 
only the 
Montreux woman and some of the females and children were 
blubbering and 
moaning, when suddenly, it seemed from nowhere, a small piece of 
paper 
fluttered from out the assembly and alighted on the desk in front 
of the 
Public Prosecutor. He took the paper up and glanced at its 
contents. I 
saw that his cheeks had paled, and that his hand trembled as he 
handed 
the paper over to me."" 
 
""And what did that paper contain, citizen Marat?"" asked Bibot, 
also 
speaking in a whisper, for an access of superstitious terror was 
gripping him by the throat. 
 
""Just the well-known accursed device, citizen, the small scarlet 
flower, 
drawn in red ink, and the few words: 'To-night the innocent men 
and 
women now condemned by this infamous tribunal will be beyond your 
reach!'"" 
 
""And no sign of a messenger?"" 
 
""None."" 
 
""And when did----"" 
 
""Hush!"" said Marat peremptorily, ""no more of that now. To your 
post, 
citizen, and remember--all are suspect! let none escape!""";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"The two men had been sitting outside a small tavern, opposite the 
Porte 
Montmartre, with a bottle of wine between them, their elbows 
resting on 
the grimy top of a rough wooden table. They had talked in 
whispers, for 
even the walls of the tumble-down cabaret might have had ears. 
 
Opposite them the city wall--broken here by the great gate of 
Montmartre--loomed threateningly in the fast-gathering dusk of 
this 
winter's afternoon. Men in ragged red shirts, their unkempt heads 
crowned with Phrygian caps adorned with a tricolour cockade, 
lounged 
against the wall, or sat in groups on the top of piles of refuse 
that 
littered the street, with a rough deal plank between them and a 
greasy 
pack of cards in their grimy fingers. Guns and bayonets were 
propped 
against the wall. The gate itself had three means of egress; each 
of 
these was guarded by two men with fixed bayonets at their 
shoulders, but 
otherwise dressed like the others, in rags--with bare legs that 
looked 
blue and numb in the cold--the sans-culottes of revolutionary 
Paris.";0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0
"Bibot rose from his seat, nodding to Marat, and joined his men. 
 
From afar, but gradually drawing nearer, came the sound of a 
ribald 
song, with chorus accompaniment sung by throats obviously 
surfeited with 
liquor. 
 
For a moment--as the sound approached--Bibot turned back once more
 to 
the Friend of the People. 
 
""Am I to understand, citizen,"" he said, ""that my orders are not to
 let 
anyone pass through these gates to-night?"" 
 
""No, no, citizen,"" replied Marat, ""we dare not do that. There are 
a 
number of good patriots in the city still. We cannot interfere 
with 
their liberty or--"" 
 
And the look of fear of the demagogue--himself afraid of the human
 
whirlpool which he has let loose--stole into Marat's cruel, 
piercing 
eyes. 
 
""No, no,"" he reiterated more emphatically, ""we cannot disregard 
the 
passports issued by the Committee of Public Safety. But examine 
each 
passport carefully, citizen Bibot! If you have any reasonable 
ground for 
suspicion, detain the holder, and if you have not----"" 
 
The sound of singing was quite near now. With another wink and a 
final 
leer, Marat drew back under the shadow of the cabaret, and Bibot 
swaggered up to the main entrance of the gate. 
 
""Qui va la?"" he thundered in stentorian tones as a group of some 
half-dozen people lurched towards him out of the gloom, still 
shouting 
hoarsely their ribald drinking song. 
 
The foremost man in the group paused opposite citizen Bibot, and 
with 
arms akimbo, and legs planted well apart tried to assume a 
rigidity of 
attitude which apparently was somewhat foreign to him at this 
moment. 
 
""Good patriots, citizen,"" he said in a thick voice which he vainly
 tried 
to render steady. 
 
""What do you want?"" queried Bibot. 
 
""To be allowed to go on our way unmolested."" 
 
""What is your way?"" 
 
""Through the Porte Montmartre to the village of Barency."" 
 
""What is your business there?"" 
 
This query delivered in Bibot's most pompous manner seemed vastly 
to 
amuse the rowdy crowd. He who was the spokesman turned to his 
friends 
and shouted hilariously: 
 
""Hark at him, citizens! He asks me what is our business. Oh, 
citizen 
Bibot, since when have you become blind? A dolt you've always 
been, else 
you had not asked the question."" 
 
But Bibot, undeterred by the man's drunken insolence, retorted 
gruffly: 
 
""Your business, I want to know."" 
 
""Bibot! my little Bibot!"" cooed the bibulous orator now in dulcet 
tones, 
""dost not know us, my good Bibot? Yet we all know thee, 
citizen--Captain 
Bibot of the Town Guard, eh, citizens! Three cheers for the 
citizen 
captain!"" 
 
When the noisy shouts and cheers from half a dozen hoarse throats 
had 
died down, Bibot, without more ado, turned to his own men at the 
gate. 
 
""Drive these drunken louts away!"" he commanded; ""no one is allowed
 to 
loiter here."" 
 
Loud protest on the part of the hilarious crowd followed, then a 
slight 
scuffle with the bayonets of the Town Guard. Finally the 
spokesman, 
somewhat sobered, once more appealed to Bibot. 
 
""Citizen Bibot! you must be blind not to know me and my mates! And
 let 
me tell you that you are doing yourself a deal of harm by 
interfering 
with the citizens of the Republic in the proper discharge of their
 
duties, and by disregarding their rights of egress through this 
gate, a 
right confirmed by passports signed by two members of the 
Committee of 
Public Safety."" 
 
He had spoken now fairly clearly and very pompously. Bibot, 
somewhat 
impressed and remembering Marat's admonitions, said very civilly: 
 
""Tell me your business then, citizen, and show me your passports. 
If 
everything is in order you may go your way."" 
 
""But you know me, citizen Bibot?"" queried the other. 
 
""Yes, I know you--unofficially, citizen Durand."" 
 
""You know that I and the citizens here are the carriers for 
citizen 
Legrand, the market gardener of Barency?"" 
 
""Yes, I know that,"" said Bibot guardedly, ""unofficially."" 
 
""Then, unofficially, let me tell you, citizen, that unless we get 
to 
Barency this evening, Paris will have to do without cabbages and 
potatoes to-morrow. So now you know that you are acting at your 
own risk 
and peril, citizen, by detaining us."" 
 
""Your passports, all of you,"" commanded Bibot. 
 
He had just caught sight of Marat still sitting outside the tavern
 
opposite, and was glad enough, in this instance, to shelve his 
responsibility on the shoulders of the popular ""Friend of the 
People."" 
There was general searching in ragged pockets for grimy papers 
with 
official seals thereon, and whilst Bibot ordered one of his men to
 take 
the six passports across the road to citizen Marat for his 
inspection, 
he himself, by the last rays of the setting winter sun, made close
 
examination of the six men who desired to pass through the Porte 
Montmartre. 
 
As the spokesman had averred, he--Bibot--knew every one of these 
men. 
They were the carriers to citizen Legrand, the Barency market 
gardener. 
Bibot knew every face. They passed with a load of fruit and 
vegetables 
in and out of Paris every day. There was really and absolutely no 
cause 
for suspicion, and when citizen Marat returned the six passports, 
pronouncing them to be genuine, and recognising his own signature 
at the 
bottom of each, Bibot was at last satisfied, and the six bibulous 
carriers were allowed to pass through the gate, which they did, 
arm in 
arm, singing a wild curmagnole, and vociferously cheering as they 
emerged out into the open. 
 
But Bibot passed an unsteady hand over his brow. It was cold, yet 
he was 
in a perspiration. That sort of thing tells on a man's nerves. He 
rejoined Marat, at the table outside the drinking booth, and 
ordered a 
fresh bottle of wine. ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"The sun had set now, and with the gathering dusk a damp mist 
descended 
on Montmartre. From the wall opposite, where the men sat playing 
cards, 
came occasional volleys of blasphemous oaths. Bibot was feeling 
much 
more like himself. He had half forgotten the incident of the six 
carriers, which had occurred nearly half an hour ago. 
 
Two or three other people had, in the meanwhile, tried to pass 
through 
the gates, but Bibot had been suspicious and had detained them 
all. 
 
Marat having commended him for his zeal took final leave of him. 
Just as 
the demagogue's slouchy, grimy figure was disappearing down a side
 
street there was the loud clatter of hoofs from that same 
direction, and 
the next moment a detachment of the mounted Town Guard, headed by 
an 
officer in uniform, galloped down the ill-paved street. 
 
Even before the troopers had drawn rein the officer had hailed 
Bibot. 
 
""Citizen,"" he shouted, and his voice was breathless, for he had 
evidently ridden hard and fast, ""this message to you from the 
citizen 
Chief Commissary of the Section. Six men are wanted by the 
Committee of 
Public Safety. They are disguised as carriers in the employ of a 
market 
gardener, and have passports for Barency!... The passports are 
stolen: 
the men are traitors--escaped aristocrats--and their spokesman is 
that 
d--d Englishman, the Scarlet Pimpernel."" 
 
Bibot tried to speak; he tugged at the collar of his ragged shirt;
 an 
awful curse escaped him. 
 
""Ten thousand devils!"" he roared. 
 
""On no account allow these people to go through,"" continued the 
officer. 
""Keep their passports. Detain them!... Understand?"" 
 
Bibot was still gasping for breath even whilst the officer, 
ordering a 
quick ""Turn!"" reeled his horse round, ready to gallop away as far 
as he 
had come. 
 
""I am for the St. Denis Gate--Grosjean is on guard there!"" he 
shouted. 
""Same orders all round the city. No one to leave the gates!... 
Understand?"" 
 
His troopers fell in. The next moment he would be gone, and those 
cursed 
aristocrats well in safety's way. 
 
""Citizen Captain!"" 
 
The hoarse shout at last contrived to escape Bibot's parched 
throat. As 
if involuntarily, the officer drew rein once more. 
 
""What is it? Quick!--I've no time. That confounded Englishman may 
be at 
the St. Denis Gate even now!"" 
 
""Citizen Captain,"" gasped Bibot, his breath coming and going like 
that 
of a man fighting for his life. ""Here!... at this gate!... not 
half an 
hour ago ... six men ... carriers ... market gardeners ... I 
seemed to 
know their faces...."" 
 
""Yes! yes! market gardener's carriers,"" exclaimed the officer 
gleefully, 
""aristocrats all of them ... and that d--d Scarlet Pimpernel. 
You've got 
them? You've detained them?... Where are they?... Speak, man, in 
the 
name of hell!..."" 
 
""Gone!"" gasped Bibot. His legs would no longer bear him. He fell 
backwards on to a heap of street debris and refuse, from which 
lowly 
vantage ground he contrived to give away the whole miserable tale.
 
 
""Gone! half an hour ago. Their passports were in order!... I 
seemed to 
know their faces! Citizen Marat was here.... He, too--"" 
 
In a moment the officer had once more swung his horse round, so 
that the 
animal reared, with wild forefeet pawing the air, with champing of
 bit, 
and white foam scattered around. 
 
""A thousand million curses!"" he exclaimed. ""Citizen Bibot, your 
head 
will pay for this treachery. Which way did they go?""";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"A dozen hands were ready to point in the direction where the merry
 party 
of carriers had disappeared half an hour ago; a dozen tongues gave
 
rapid, confused explanations. 
 
""Into it, my men!"" shouted the officer; ""they were on foot! They 
can't 
have gone far. Remember the Republic has offered ten thousand 
francs for 
the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel."" 
 
Already the heavy gates had been swung open, and the officer's 
voice 
once more rang out clear through a perfect thunder-clap of fast 
galloping hoofs: 
 
""Ventre a terre! Remember!--ten thousand francs to him who first 
sights 
the Scarlet Pimpernel!""";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"The thunder-clap died away in the distance, the dust of four score
 hoofs 
was merged in the fog and in the darkness; the voice of the 
captain was 
raised again through the mist-laden air. One shout ... a shout of 
triumph ... then silence once again. ";0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0
"Bibot had fainted on the heap of debris. 
 
His comrades brought him wine to drink. He gradually revived. Hope
 came 
back to his heart; his nerves soon steadied themselves as the 
heavy 
beverage filtrated through into his blood. 
 
""Bah!"" he ejaculated as he pulled himself together, ""the troopers 
were 
well-mounted ... the officer was enthusiastic; those carriers 
could not 
have walked very far. And, in any case, I am free from blame. 
Citoyen 
Marat himself was here and let them pass!"" 
 
A shudder of superstitious terror ran through him as he 
recollected the 
whole scene: for surely he knew all the faces of the six men who 
had 
gone through the gate. The devil indeed must have given the 
mysterious 
Englishman power to transmute himself and his gang wholly into the
 
bodies of other people. ";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
"More than an hour went by. Bibot was quite himself again, 
bullying, 
commanding, detaining everybody now. 
 
At that time there appeared to be a slight altercation going on, 
on the 
farther side of the gate. Bibot thought it his duty to go and see 
what 
the noise was about. Someone wanting to get into Paris instead of 
out of 
it at this hour of the night was a strange occurrence. 
 
Bibot heard his name spoken by a raucous voice. Accompanied by two
 of 
his men he crossed the wide gates in order to see what was 
happening. 
One of the men held a lanthorn, which he was swinging high above 
his 
head. Bibot saw standing there before him, arguing with the guard 
by the 
gate, the bibulous spokesman of the band of carriers. 
 
He was explaining to the sentry that he had a message to deliver 
to the 
citizen commanding at the Porte Montmartre. 
 
""It is a note,"" he said, ""which an officer of the mounted guard 
gave me. 
He and twenty troopers were galloping down the great North Road 
not far 
from Barency. When they overtook the six of us they drew rein, and
 the 
officer gave me this note for citizen Bibot and fifty francs if I 
would 
deliver it tonight."" 
 
""Give me the note!"" said Bibot calmly. 
 
But his hand shook as he took the paper; his face was livid with 
fear 
and rage. 
 
The paper had no writing on it, only the outline of a small 
scarlet 
flower done in red--the device of the cursed Englishman, the 
Scarlet 
Pimpernel. 
 
""Which way did the officer and the twenty troopers go,"" he 
stammered, 
""after they gave you this note?"" 
 
""On the way to Calais,"" replied the other, ""but they had 
magnificent 
horses, and didn't spare them either. They are a league and more 
away by 
now!"" 
 
All the blood in Bibot's body seemed to rush up to his head, a 
wild 
buzzing was in his ears....";1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0
